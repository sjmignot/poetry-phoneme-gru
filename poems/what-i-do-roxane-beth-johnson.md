# What I Do
## Roxane Beth Johnson
Eat cereal. Read the back of the box over and over. Put on my red velvet
jumper with white heart shaped buttons. Walk to the bus, pick up discarded
cigarette butts and pretend to smoke.

Get on the bus. Girls yell, _Wire head, ugly black skin._ Take a window seat,
under the radio speaker. Look for cats hunting in the fields.

Go to class. Stay in at recess. Steal chewing gum, plastic green monkeys and
cookies from desks. Eat in bathroom stalls. Pure white light pours in.

Try to get a bloody nose by punching myself in the same bathroom after lunch.

The teacher passes around pictures of herself pregnant. _You were_ _fat!_ I
yell.  Everyone laughs. I lap it like licking honey from a spoon. _I was
pregnant, what’s your excuse?_ Everyone laughs. I swallow stones.

Grow tired in the afternoons, droop like a sunflower in the lengthening light.

Get on the bus. Girls yell, _Brillo-head! Zebra!_ Sit in an aisle seat. _Your
father’s a nigger!_ I say, _No, he’s a fireman_. Laughter all around. Pinch
myself shut like squeezing soap from a sponge.

Walk home. Sometimes find an unsmoked cigarette in the gravel along the
curb—long, white, new. Put it to my lips, pull it away and hold it aloft,
movie-star-like, all the way home.
