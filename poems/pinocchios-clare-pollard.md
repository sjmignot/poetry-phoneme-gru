Marionette means little Mary. Think of Mary Shelley, a jointed doll lifted
from her mother’s unstitched interior, that fist-shaped hole, the future
mother of three dead children and Frankenstein’s monstrous electric baby,
hater of creators. Think of all the porn-dollies moving their mouths up and
down on wood and the way the men jerk, responding as they’re made to, and the
clear wires. The men who make up cyborgs, beautiful and silver-skulled with
wet mouths that might deliver quick blue shocks. Think of Eve’s small teeth
kinking apple flesh and who put it there and who suggested and who lifted her
wrist. Think of shadow puppets with enormous penises. Think of little boys
shot for holding up toy guns. Think of animals compared to puppets by
Aristotle — how levers are released and strike the twisted sinews against one
another. Think of people compared to animals. Think of men on a bus forcing
instruments so far inside a girl they puppet the girl to death and puppet
means pulled by tendons. Think of if you’re happy and you know it clap your
hands. Think of the grace of a marionette as it glances the earth, as its
limbs shake and float. Think of how its mind is elsewhere.

Fox and Cat hang Pinocchio
from the tree, a noose
of string around his throat.
Hoist by what he’s made of,
the merciless weather
swings him to clatter
like a wedding bell that rings
out atrocious spasms
to a shuddered stop.
His maker is not here
for this unmaking.
They should make him watch.
