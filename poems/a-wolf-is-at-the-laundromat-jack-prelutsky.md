# A Wolf Is at the Laundromat
## Jack Prelutsky
A wolf is at the Laundromat,
it's not a wary stare-wolf,
it's short and fat, it tips its hat,
unlike a scary glare-wolf.

It combs its hair, it clips its toes,
it is a fairly rare wolf,
that's only there to clean its clothesâ€”
it is a wash-and-wear-wolf.
