# Chinese Silence No. 30
## Timothy Yu
after Eleanor Goodman, "Boston's Chinatown"
It’s easy to slam the Chinatowns of America.
They’re just a lot of red lanterns.
Yeah, there are Chinese people around,
But it’s all for tourists.

Their dirty alleyways remind me
Of that strange beast called American culture.
The peculiar smell of fish (how Chinese!)—
I’ve eaten hundreds of meals there.

So I move on to mock the shantytowns of Asia.
They’re just a lot of plywood and scrap metal.
Sure, I know there are poor people around.
I’ve seen _Slumdog Millionaire._

I know the area pretty well.
I’ve hung out in “bad” neighborhoods before
Where the old men run their sketchy basement stores
But they have mostly disappeared.

And it’s all too tempting to denigrate
The postindustrial towns of the dull Midwest.
Of course I know there are unemployed people there.
I heard it on NPR.

Once I had to spend three hours
In the Detroit airport, with its vendors peddling
Chewing gum and soda.
But people don’t really live there.

Just don’t ask me to smash the glittering cities
Of cultural imperialism.
They teach English language skills
And how to adjust to life in the States.

Nobody really lives here.
As someone involved in translation
I’ve eaten hundreds of meals here.
Nobody speaks Chinese.
