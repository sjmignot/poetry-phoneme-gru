# Three Deer in Oquossoc
## Sonja Johanson
East will take me back. I drive
west. I wend between snowbanks,
until the road delivers me
to a sleeping boat launch.

They stand on the frozen ramp;
watch me with coats that are
better than mine. Ice houses
and snowmobiles edge the distance.

 _I have to turn around,_ I say
to them, _I went the wrong_
 _way._ They stamp and chuff.
 _No,_ they tell me, _this is the way._
