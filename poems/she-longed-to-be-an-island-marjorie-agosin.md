# She longed to be an island
## Marjorie Agos√≠n
She longed to be an island,

She loved the unbridled madness of them, the islands,

She longed to arrive to an island that, perhaps, wasn't an island

Divest herself of the ruinous, stony loves

She longed to be an island
To only inhabit the sea's waistline
And not leave or return
To only be an island
Island of the night
Island of the dawn
Islands.
