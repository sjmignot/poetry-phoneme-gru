# Booranga Wire Songs
## Samuel Wagan Watson
For Anthony Lawrence
A large gray jumped, what I can only imagine is a dingo fence last night and
made it at least 5 feet off the ground, under a full moon a million miles
away, granite rocks and pine trees sealing a Cormac McCarthy evening. Wire
song on cold wind musing low, tension wang and resonance, the land and ghosts
play along and now and then a sheep _bleets_ , but it hardly makes a bar onto
these wire songs ...

_Small spinifex spin
down from a spirit circle;
the writers cottage ... _

_(A pact made above the cottage by local artisans … winds rest for the time
being ... )_

No ghosting to report on this tour but aplenty haunting of words, sentences
prematurely entertained that have the capacity to poltergeist and a writer’s
biting off; too much in a spell! To only want that wire song later to floss
with, when civilized nights of too much consumer discount become morose, head
aching to be left alone and  everyone thinks you need to be alone when you
only want to sing aloud and be heard in the ides of a full moon over pine
trees and granite boulders, simple, wire song ...
