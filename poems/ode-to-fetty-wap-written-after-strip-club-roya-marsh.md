# Ode to Fetty Wap (written after strip club)
## Roya Marsh
A reading  from the book of  Willie Maxwell 679:1738
...    then Rap Gawd formed a man
from the dust of the auto-tune
&breathed into his nostrils
the breath of Rémy Martin
the man became Fetty Wap.

Rap Gawd saw fit to
make Fetty a counterpart.
so he caused the man to fall into a deep sleep;
while he was sleeping
he took one of the man’s eyes
then closed up the place with flesh.
then the Rap Gawd made a woman
from the eye he had taken out of the man.

the creation story of Fetty
the first trap rapper to make a song
I might play at my wedding.

there’s a choir of church mothers
smiling down on the brown boy
that sings of a woman’s worth
in a culture destined to nullify it.

do you know how long
sisters been waiting
for a brother
to willingly let us hit the bando?
(after patiently explaining what the fuck that means.)

 _l’union fait la force_
your music emblematic of the motto of Haiti
unity makes strength

as we scream **SQUAAADDDD!**
the weight of that bass
hits hard
like Gawd’s tears
landing on glow in the dark floors
’cause Gawd does not just “cry”
He makes it rain
on a crowd of women
in heels higher than most GPAs
dancing their way through
nursing school
&out of some deadbeat’s
roach-filled 1 bedroom.

the fellas
big brother
arm-wrapped shoulders
singing off-key
about Ki’s &pies
and other shit
they have no real idea about.

the only song in the club
that allows a hetero male
to gaze into the eyes
of another
[suspected] hetero male
and/or stranger
singing his fucking heart out.

make him more mathematician
than murderer
spewing lyrics repping
the urban district’s finest cognac
this
is a black man’s
“Sweet Caroline”
oh, oh, oh!

Fetty, you got me —
I, too, see heaven
peering through
the pearly-gated smile
of that gap-toothed princess
in your video.

I, too, have a glock in my rari —
in the form of a master’s degree
but don’t get it twisted
this summa cum laude bloaw
anytime a motherfucker think
they know me!
&my trap look a lot
like a dimly-lit cafe
with semicold
red stripes
a microphone
a couple judges
but I’ll be damned
if anyone tell me
I ain’t a **queen of this shit**.

&then I blink
&the bass subsides
&the song fades
into another brother
caring more
about his golden grill
than making the best
of a family business.

&she picks up her ass
her purse
slides off the pole
disappears
into a mixture
of low-budget smoke machines
&catcalling men

wedding bands tangled
in the drawstring of their sweats

&another Saturday twerks
itself into the crisp breeze of Sunday morning
&the church mothers glance over the room
covered in government-issued confetti
&Gawd smiles
as they bellow in unison

“I want you to be mine again!”
