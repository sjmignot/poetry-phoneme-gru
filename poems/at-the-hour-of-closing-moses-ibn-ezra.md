# At the Hour of Closing
## Moses ibn Ezra
_Lord of wondrous workings,_
 _grant us understanding—_
 _now at the hour of closing._

A chosen few are called,
     their eyes toward you lifting—
they stand exalted in their trembling
 _now, at the hour of closing._

They pour forth their souls;
     erase, then, their straying—
and grant them, Lord, your absolution
 _now at the hour of closing._

Be a shelter for them
     through all their suffering;
consign them only to rejoicing
 _now, at the hour of closing._

Show them your compassion,
     in your justice turning
on all who brought oppression to them—
 _now at the hour of closing._

Recall their fathers’ merit
     and count it as merit for them;
renew their days as once they were,
 _now, at the hour of closing._

Call for the year of grace—
     the remnant flock’s returning
to Oholìbah and Oholàh—
 _now at the hour of closing._
