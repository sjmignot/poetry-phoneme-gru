# Portrait of My Father as a Young Black Man
## Sjohnna McCray
--Cincinnati, Ohio, 1987
Rage is the language of men,
          layers of particulates fused.

          Rage is the wine
                    father pours to the ground

                    for men whose time has passed. Rage
                    is gripped in the hands

          like the neck of a broom held tight. Rage
gets stuck in the throat, suppressed.

Rage is a promise kept.
