# Muscadine
## Mary Moore Easter
peach of a grape

                           in his fingertips

                                                        like holding home

            he noses its musk

 _Taste_ , he says

                         and parts my lips with a globe and

a thumb I lick

                                                        I bite the thick skin

                           His Arkansas aches

                                                                      sweet
on my tongue

                           His hand vines my chin my throat

My face flames

                                To the lady on the bus

                                                          he brags

                                                                          _Her
blush comes from my touch.
_

 _Better to marry than to burn_

                          she quotes

                                         She don’t know us
