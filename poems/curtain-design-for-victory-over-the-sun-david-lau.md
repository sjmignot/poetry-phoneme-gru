# Curtain Design for Victory Over the Sun
## David Lau
My observation are as follows: still dirty
“in the wisdom” that is constructivist
red theatre pieces, bike gloves all
like a mashed crop of dyed hair,
a bad crop this year.

We started the play at once:
 _An Enemy of the People._
A Buddha of lapidary contrition enters,
hospice, tears, _La Clemenza di Tito_ interlude

rolled in tulips of decisive consequence.

 _Sprezzatura_. Our row
throws that cosmic scratch,
apotropaic, scalene
back to the corner pocket
angle on the hustle—

“ _Live at the Paradox._ ”
