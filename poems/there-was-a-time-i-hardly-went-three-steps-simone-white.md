# There was a time I hardly went three steps
## Simone White
Except another black girl was with me.

Mother. Always lonely. I am always.
Mother those girls. Forty-two.

March summer. Light blue. Vermont.
Endless crescent. Invert as a tyke lake.

Fernet Mother, I'm grown. Forest.
San Francisco. Lone cold.

Stone turd. Talk three or none.
Kidding.
Kidding.
