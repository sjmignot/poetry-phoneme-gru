# Sunder
## Atsuro Riley
A last rock-skip hurlstorm (crazing river-glass)
the closest they ever were.


•


In right lockstitch
snared and split some fire-supper cooked on sticks.


•


By dawn the older brother took to chucking
what bottle-frags he could find and crud-oysters across.
The (high-pitched) younger blacked our waters


with a yowl.


•


_Lord the sound such as rose from him_
_carried so_ —
Carved
into us. Clings.


•


Hadn’t they clung tooth and claw to branch and bark.
— Came a man (and truck) to take them off.


•


_Dieseled those boys off_
_away_
_some say somewheres upcountry,_
_inland._


•


Where it was they landed (why) nobody not them knows.


•


No body not them knows
just how they humped and grubbled home
what road they’d graved what woods criss-crossed
which creeks which trains they’d hopped who helped.


•


_Came safe home sure        but blank as houses_.
Came safe home       —as him  —and him.


—as (evermore) not them.
