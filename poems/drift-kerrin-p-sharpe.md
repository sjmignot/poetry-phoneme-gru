# drift
## Kerrin P. Sharpe
in his white light dreams
at Discovery Hut
Herbert Ponting meets
the Siberian ponies
he’d once photographed
on the _Terra Nova_

the ponies no longer flexible
refuse to wear
equine pajamas
or trap their hooves
in bamboo snowshoes
for his Royal Collection

inside the stomach of ice
the ponies more still
than life soften
the silver shadows
of Scott and his team
and turn from Herbert’s bromide

into the drift
and whiff of themselves
