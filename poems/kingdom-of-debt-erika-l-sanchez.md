# Kingdom of Debt
## Erika L. Sánchez
According to a report from the University of San Diego's Justice in Mexico
project, 138,000 people have been murdered in Mexico since 2006.
They call it the corner of heaven:
a laboratory, a foot at the throat
of an empire. Before the holy
dirt, the woman with the feline gait
waits with tangled hair, mouth
agape — the letter _X_ marked
on what’s left of her breasts
and face. _Nuestra Belleza
_
Mexicana. A roped mule
watches a man place a crown
on her severed head. Tomorrow
the queen will be picked clean
by the kindness of the sea.
Shuttered shops and empty
restaurants. Stray dogs couple
in a courtyard. Under a swaying
palm tree, a cluster of men
finger golden pistols, whisper,
 _aquí ni se paran las moscas_.
Two boys, transfixed, watch
a pixelated video: a family fed
to a swarm of insatiable pigs.
A butcher sweeps blood
from an empty street. _Death
_
is my godmother, he repeats.
_Death is a burnt mirror_.
When the crackling stereo
dithers between stations —  _amor
_
de mis amores, sangre de mi alma —
a gaggle of silent children
gather before a sputtering
trash bin. Together they watch
the terror hover like flies.
