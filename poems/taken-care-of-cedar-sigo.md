# Taken Care Of
## Cedar Sigo
I come from Inuit oil money,
From instruments of chance and divination.
The most loose, shut in, wavering mind,
Recording my day with recitations, antennae,
Narration and figure, my phone might die. I'm walking dirty.
Shop and mob cops, not to touch my mother's breast
Or the queen's royal crown signature
Izzy Jujuâ€"hijacked, forsaking all others.
The untamed scotch is mine. It cost the picture a fortune
To say nothing of my turban, costume copies
Of topaz bracelets, the umpteenth translation.
Did you ever know Micah, Gay Sunshine, Grace Cathedral, Coconut?
I went from heels at Barneys to the depths of the bins.
Who could be like dropping in? I'll fold both my hands
In gloves and wait, Hope Diamond peeking out.
