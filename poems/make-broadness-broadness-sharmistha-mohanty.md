# "Make broadness broadness"
## Sharmistha Mohanty
Make broadness broadness
from narrowness
Lead lead us
We see nothing
behind nothing ahead
These worlds are broad above
beyond our knowing
The great river plains open and descend
slowly from west to east
beyond our knowing
Us
Doctor, suture me from
narrowness to broadness
All the suns all the dawns all the waters
rise and pass
in broadness
Our bodies move over over this land
rising and falling
Broadness
stretch out our skies and dawns
so we can walk walk
out of our selves
Doctor, move me from dark
spaces of invented light
I do not know just
what it is
that I am like
Broadness open for
us us
Unharness our days
