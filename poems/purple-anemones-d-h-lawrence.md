# Purple Anemones
## D. H. Lawrence
_Who gave us flowers?_
 _Heaven? The white God?_

Nonsense!
Up out of hell,
From Hades;
Infernal Dis!

 _Jesus the god of flowers—?_
Not he.
 _Or sun-bright Apollo, him so musical?_
Him neither.

 _Who then?_
 _Say who._
Say it—and it is Pluto,
Dis
The dark one
Proserpine’s master.

 _Who contradicts—?_

When she broke forth from below,
Flowers came, hell-hounds on her heels.
Dis, the dark, the jealous god, the husband,
Flower-sumptuous-blooded.

 _Go then,_ he said.
And in Sicily, on the meadows of Enna,
She thought she had left him;
But opened around her purple anemones,

Caverns,
Little hells of color, caves of darkness,
Hell, risen in pursuit of her; royal, sumptuous
Pit-falls.

All at her feet
Hell opening;
At her white ankles
Hell rearing its husband-splendid, serpent heads,
Hell-purple, to get at her—
 _Why did he let her go?_
So he could track her down again, white victim.

Ah mastery!
Hell’s husband-blossoms
Out on earth again.

Look out, Persephone!
You, Madame Ceres, mind yourself, the enemy is upon you.
About your feet spontaneous aconite,
Hell-glamorous, and purple husband-tyranny
Enveloping your late-enfranchised plains.

You thought your daughter had escaped?
No more stockings to darn for the flower-roots, down in hell?
But ah my dear!

Aha, the stripe-cheeked whelps, whippet-slim crocuses,
 _At ’em, boys, at ’em!_
 _Ho golden-spaniel, sweet alert narcissus,_
 _Smell ’em, smell ’em out!_
Those two enfranchised women.

Somebody is coming!
 _Oho there!_

Dark blue anemones!
Hell is up!
Hell on earth, and Dis within the depths!

 _Run, Persephone, he is after you already._

 _Why did he let her go?_
To track her down;
All the sport of summer and spring, and flowers snapping
               at her ankles and catching her by the hair!
Poor Persephone and her rights for women.

 _Husband-snared hell-queen,_
 _It is spring._

It is spring,
And pomp of husband-strategy on earth.

 _Ceres, kiss your girl, you think you’ve got her back._
 _The bit of husband-tilth she is,_
 _Persephone!_

Poor mothers-in-law!
They are always sold.

It is spring.
