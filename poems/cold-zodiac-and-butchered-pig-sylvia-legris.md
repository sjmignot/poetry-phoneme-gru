# Cold Zodiac and Butchered Pig
## Sylvia Legris
Onward the fairweather spleen.
Onward the season of vent and caprice.

 _Giovedì Grasso_ flies the meat,
trees still larded with winter grease —
ice, the Dead Time, the Flensing Time.

Flirt fattened Thursday of December’s gorge.
The twelve pigs of the zodiac stew the zeal,
slow simmering giddy fizzling squeals.

Uncloister the close-air surgical theater.
Ungristle the knife-jester’s grip.

Let the butcher carnival begin!
