# Residence on Earth
## Arthur Sze
As we approached the front door, I noticed
grills on the windows, bullet pockmarks

in the wall; inside, a maid served us salad,
potato and cilantro soup—and I saw,

in the amphitheater above Medellín,
the stage where twenty-eight poets read;

clouds gathered; in the ensuing downpour,
I expected the five thousand people to rush out;

instead, a sea of umbrellas appeared,
and people swayed under them; when the readings

resumed, a poet stood, chanted in Vietnamese,
and when I stepped up to the podium,

two rivers flowed down the steps to the far right
and left; as I read _our emotions resemble leaves
_

and alive to their shapes we are nourished,
I understood how poets from all over the world

had come for peace, solidarity, justice—
and when my host, and reader of my poems

in Spanish, invited me into his home, I saw
one way to live during our _residencia en la tierra._
