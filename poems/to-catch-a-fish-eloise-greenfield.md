# To Catch a Fish
## Eloise Greenfield
It takes more than a wish
to catch a fish
you take the hook
you add the bait
you concentrate
and then you wait
you wait     you wait
but not a bite
the fish don’t have
an appetite
so tell them what
good bait you’ve got
and how your bait
can hit the spot
this works a whole
lot better than
a wish
if you really
want to catch
a fish
