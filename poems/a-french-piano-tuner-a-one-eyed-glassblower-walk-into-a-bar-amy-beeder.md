# A French Piano Tuner & a One-Eyed Glassblower Walk into a Bar
## Amy Beeder
Would you rather hear the louche pun drawn
from _glory hole, lip wrap_ or  _fingering_

or hear a tiny hammer striking wire?
Would you rather see the molten birthing glass?

Seat Eros next to Kronos, for the banter. _I heard_
_she’s yet unplowed — I heard your quiver dangled down —_

_I heard you dwell in borrowed forms — love’s nothing_
_but glimmer-to-wither, dawn’s fireflies expired._

In this place we sift  & bounce the words like dice
thrice dip a pipe into the magma, _o my stars_.

Lear  & Gloucester walk into a bar
debating again the color of bluffs or moors

or cormorants: _like craquelure     like damp tea leaf_
_driftwood    no, peat steam    no, brined sand-apple ink_

Were all your letters in fact suns?
Forgotten, after all that trouble —

Are those bellows blowing some?
A field of broken bottles, fragments blue.

A tune invented to divert a girl.
