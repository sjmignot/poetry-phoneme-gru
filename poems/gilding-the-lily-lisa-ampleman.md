To keep anxiety at bay, my friend called chemo _dragonfly love_. Those insects
— christened, in places, the devil’s darning needles — hover as they contort
their joined bodies into a heart, the male with pincers. Finger cutter, horse
killer, ear stick, eye pisser. _Look closely at the eyes of a female darner
and you may well see dark puncture marks._ As a slow drip through an IV. As a
pill. Through a port into a vein. She called nausea _erotica_. Just the same,
we name our storms to lessen them —  not a tropical cyclone, but _Arabella_ ,
with ballet shoes and bun. Tumors, too, were _friends_ , waiting at the bus
stop with backpacks in the morning. Cindy French braids Carrie’s hair, yanking
at the scalp to form the tight crisscross. Not hair loss, but _deep
conditioning_. She gave us the new lexicon on stationery embossed with a red
rose speckled by raindrops. The stem still had its thorns. Ring-around-the-
rosy, red rover, red rover, send her right over. She called death _the world
of_ _10_ _,_ _000_ _things_ : the dragon courting its damsel, catheter tubing
in the wastebin, video of a toddler biting his brother, pas de deux, full-
sugar ice cream, Crimson Queen, Trumpeter, Red Knockout, Tuscany Superb  ...
I knew her as Rose Shapiro. At the funeral I learned she was born
_Passalacqua_ : to cross the river, to pass a glass of water.
