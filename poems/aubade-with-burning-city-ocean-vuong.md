# Aubade with Burning City
## Ocean Vuong
South Vietnam, April 29, 1975: Armed Forces Radio played Irving Berlin's
"White Christmas" as a code to begin Operation Frequent Wind, the ultimate
evacuation of American civilians and Vietnamese refugees by helicopter during
the fall of Saigon.

            Milkflower petals on the street
                                                     like pieces of a girl’s
dress.

 _May your days be merry and bright_ __...

He fills a teacup with champagne, brings it to her lips.
 _Open_ , he says.
                                        She opens.
                                                      Outside, a soldier spits
out
            his cigarette as footsteps
                            fill the square like stones fallen from the sky.
_May all
_
 _your Christmases be white_ as the traffic guard
            unstraps his holster.

                                        His hand running the hem
of  her white dress.
                            His black eyes.
            Her black hair.
                            A single candle.
                                        Their shadows: two wicks.

A military truck speeds through the intersection, the sound of children
                                        shrieking inside. A bicycle hurled
            through a store window. When the dust rises, a black dog
                            lies in the road, panting. Its hind legs
crushed into the shine
 _of a white Christmas_.

On the nightstand, a sprig of magnolia expands like a secret heard
                                                                      for the
first time.

 _The treetops glisten and children listen_ , the chief of police
                                facedown in a pool of Coca-Cola.
                                             A palm-sized photo of his father
soaking
                beside his left ear.

The song moving through the city like a widow.
 _A white_... _A white_... _I’m dreaming of_ a curtain of snow

                                                          falling from her
shoulders.

Snow crackling against the window. Snow shredded

                                           with gunfire. Red sky.
                              Snow on the tanks rolling over the city walls.
A helicopter lifting the living just out of reach.

            The city so white it is ready for ink.

                                                     The radio saying run run
run.
Milkflower petals on a black dog
                            like pieces of a girl’s dress.

 _May your days be merry and bright_. She is saying
            something neither of them can hear. The hotel rocks
                        beneath them. The bed a field of ice
cracking.

 _Don’t worry_ , he says, as the first bomb brightens
                             their faces, _my brothers have won the war
_
 _and tomorrow_  ...
                                             The lights go out.

 _I’m dreaming. I’m dreaming_  ...
 _to hear sleigh bells in the snow_  ...

In the square below: a nun, on fire,
                                            runs silently toward her god —

                           _Open_ , he says.
                                                         She opens.
