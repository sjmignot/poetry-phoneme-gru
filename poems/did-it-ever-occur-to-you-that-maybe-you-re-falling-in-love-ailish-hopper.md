# Did It Ever Occur to You That Maybe You're Falling in Love?
## Ailish Hopper
We buried the problem.
We planted a tree over the problem.
We regretted our actions toward the problem.
We declined to comment on the problem.
We carved a memorial to the problem, dedicated it. Forgot our handkerchief.
We removed all “unnatural” ingredients, handcrafted a locally-grown tincture
for the problem. But nobody bought it.
We freshly-laundered, bleached, deodorized the problem.
We built a wall around the problem, tagged it with pictures of children, birds
in trees.
We renamed the problem, and denounced those who used the old name.
We wrote a law for the problem, but it died in committee.
We drove the problem out with loud noises from homemade  instruments.
We marched, leafleted, sang hymns, linked arms with the problem, got dragged
to jail, got spat on by the problem and let out.
We elected an official who Finally Gets the problem.
We raised an army to corral and question the problem. They went door to door
but could never ID.
We made www.problem.com so You Can Find Out About the  problem, and
www.problem.org so You Can Help.
We created 1-800-Problem, so you could Report On the problem, and
1-900-Problem so you could Be the Only Daddy That Really Turns That problem
On.
We drove the wheels offa that problem.
We rocked the shit out of that problem.
We amplified the problem, turned it on up, and blew it out.
We drank to forget the problem.
We inhaled the problem, exhaled the problem, crushed its ember under our shoe.
We put a title on the problem, took out all the articles, conjunctions, and
verbs. Called it “Exprmntl Prblm.”
We shot the problem, and put it out of its misery.
We swallowed daily pills for the problem, followed a problem fast, drank
problem tea.
We read daily problem horoscopes. Had our problem palms read by a seer.
We prayed.
Burned problem incense.
Formed a problem task force. Got a problem degree. Got on the problem tenure
track. Got a problem retirement plan.
We gutted and renovated the problem. We joined the Neighborhood Problem
Development Corp.
We listened and communicated with the problem, only to find out that it had
gone for the day.
We mutually empowered the problem.
We kissed and stroked the problem, we fucked the problem all night. Woke up to
an empty bed.
We watched carefully for the problem, but our flashlight died.
We had dreams of the problem. In which we could no longer  recognize
ourselves.
We reformed. We transformed. Turned over a new leaf. Turned a corner, found
ourselves near a scent that somehow reminded us of the problem,
In ways we could never
Put into words. That
Little I-can’t-explain-it
That makes it hard to think. That
Rings like a siren inside.
