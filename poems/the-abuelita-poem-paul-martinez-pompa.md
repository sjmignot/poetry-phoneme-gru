# The Abuelita Poem
## Paul Martínez Pompa
I. SKIN & CORN

Her brown skin glistens as the sun
pours through the kitchen window
like gold _leche._ After grinding
the _nixtamal_ , a word so beautifully ethnic
it must not only be italicized but underlined
to let you, the reader, know you’ve encountered
something beautifully ethnic, she kneads
with the hands of centuries-old ancestor
spirits who magically yet realistically posses her
until the _masa_ is smooth as a _lowrider’s_
chrome bumper. And I know she must do this
with care because it says so on a website
that explains how to make homemade corn _tortillas._
So much labor for this peasant bread,
this edible art birthed from _Abuelitas’s_
brown skin, which is still glistening
in the sun.


II. APOLOGY

Before she died I called my abuelita
 _grandma._ I cannot remember
if she made corn tortillas from scratch
but, O, how she’d flip the factory fresh
El Milagros (Quality Since 1950)
on the burner, bathe them in butter
& salt for her grandchildren.
How she’d knead the buttons
on the telephone, order me food
from Pizza Hut. I assure you,
gentle reader, this was done
with the spirit of Mesoamérica
ablaze in her fingertips.
