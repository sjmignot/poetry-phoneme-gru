# First Divorce
## Diane Gilliam Fisher
There was a bucket, there was a wall,
there was a woman and a man.

The woman carried the bucket
and the man was the wall.
There was no place else to go.

It was a long, long time
for there was much to carry
and there was much to wall.

There was a path ran straight
from the well to the hole in the wall.
There was a path ran crooked
from the well to the wood.

There was something in the wood
bigger than the bucket.

Woe to the man, woe to the wall.
Woe to the bucket at the edge
of the wood.
