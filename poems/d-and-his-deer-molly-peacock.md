# D and His Deer
## Molly Peacock
D always felt, somehow or other, double. He was an upright line, but then
again, he was a curve. When he looked in the mirror straight on, he saw the
dapper features of the diplomat he was. But sideways, if he took off his horn-
rimmed glasses, he imagined he could be taken for a rather distinguished Dame.
He always saw both sides to everything.
     Would he ever find his dæmon—the divine spirit within? Did he really have
_one_ spirit? D seemed to be singing a duet with himself.
     Seeing both sides made him a champion procrastinator. D dilly-dallied.
Waited till the last minute to decide anything. At every posting, he drove the
staff crazy. But that was diplomacy.
     Now dusk dropped on the gated embassy grounds. D flipped on his desk
lamp, and the pool of light shut out the trees, looming and dissolving. D drew
the drapes, deaf to the delicate drone of insect wings. He returned to his
desk, trying to distract himself from a strange little pain that had come to
him all his life, like a recurrent dream. (Except, he had to confess, he never
dreamed.) The pain was a distinct tiny stab in a spot, well, what would you
call that? D called it _down there._
     For years, since he was a little d, he considered all the options about
this strange pain. It was nothing, really. He went long times between feeling
it. Maybe it was too slight to worry about, but then again . . . At last D
decided to see a doctor. As a matter of fact, he saw a number.
     “Tell me your dreams,” the first doctor said.
     “Don't bother to ask me, I never dream,” D said.
     “In dreams begin responsibilities,” the doctor quoted.
     D demanded a referral.
     “I've got a very specific pain,” he said to the next doctor. He pointed
to, well, down there.
      “Your testicle,” the physician said. Which required a test. Several. And
more.
      Finally the second doctor read all the results and announced, “Aha, a
dermoid cyst.” What? Inside the cyst were hair follicles and an eye-type thing
with eyelashes and a tooth.
     “Do you think I was a twin?” D wondered with a weird kind of delight as
he examined the x-ray.
     Well, the doctor wouldn’t go that far. These dermoid cysts were usually
removed in childhood. No reason, however, to remove it now. D wouldn’t dream
of having it removed! It explained everything! That slightly creepy darling
little creature in there _must_ have been a twin, someone D had grown around
as she dissolved. D was convinced it was a twin sister.
     And D had absorbed her. Of course he wanted to keep her with him.
     That very day, he had his first dream.
     Exhausted after his discovery, he had returned to the embassy in the late
afternoon. Unable to face his office, he diverted his steps from the front
walk toward the deserted path on the grounds where no one ever seemed to
stroll. He walked deeper into the woods. The path sloped into a shaded dimple
in the earth.
     It was dusk in the dell.
     D heard the drone of insect wings. In the mottled light a dragonfly dove
straight down. Up curved a damselfly.
     Impulsively D lay down in the leaves in his three-piece suit and curled
up like a praying divine, two hands under his chin. He felt himself melting a
little. All the old bedevilments dispersed into a delicate dampness. The world
softened from darkling to darling . . .

. . .  _A stately antlered stag appeared in the distance and slowly, with a
calm command, walked closer until D could see that he wore a diamond necklace
around his neck. The stag slowly bowed his head, doffed his entire rack of
antlers, and raised his head up again, looking directly at D._
 _Now the deer was a doe! The doe blinked her eyes at D, as if waking. Then
she donned the antlers, and turned and walked_ _away . . ._

D woke up ravenously hungry—and overjoyed.
     He dusted himself off and drove straight to dinner. As he stared out the
restaurant window, eating his dumplings, he wondered if responsibilities
really do begin in dreams.
     _Maybe dreams are responsible to us,_ he thought.
     He felt his sister inside him. She was the reason he was a debonair man,
a man who understood that everything has two sides: inner/outer, yes/no. D
thought both in lines as sharp as the creases in trousers, and in curves like
the swirls of a skirt.
 _What do I really know?_ he asked himself. Only that he had woken strangely
endeared to himself—and satisfied. Now he understood the necessity of delay.
To wait, and then to discover. Never to have only one answer.
     The napkin at the restaurant had come rolled inside a little sparkly
ring. “Add this to my bill,” he said to the waiter. And pocketed the little
diadem as a reminder of the dyad he was.
