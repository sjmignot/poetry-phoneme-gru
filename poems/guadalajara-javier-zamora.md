We knew something was wrong when next to the TV, a large tomatillo plant was
growing out the carpet. Everything there spoke, Table, Lamps    ...

In the living room, Coffee Table’s eyes glued to the TV: flags, drums, hands
on the chest on the screen, but it couldn’t have been Independence. It was the
fifth of the fifth month, something about a battle won, a battle lost.

Our host, Dining Table, handed each of us a green sphere. _Eat, s’il vous
plaît. Don’t think about it_ , she told us; then sent Chair and Coffee Table
to sleep.

 _Watch the bedbugs. You can’t unlock the windows,_ Fan in the hallway said.

For two weeks Table left tomatillos outside our door. The green marbles
punched through our stomachs, so deep, our ears grew roots. It was as if no
heat. Bed wished she was bigger. Closet dreaded his clothes. Wall didn’t let
us sleep; kept saying,

 _¡Look! Look over there, cabrones. You’ll never make it there. If you’re
gonna ask for the best route, the best price. ¿Where are your suspenders?
¿Dress shoes? You’re not really serious about getting to San Francisco. ¿Are
you? Pinche dirty pigeons._
