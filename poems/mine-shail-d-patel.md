# Mine
## Shail D. Patel
Pain trains an undisciplined mind.
_I will end yours if  you end mine._

Little feet, little feet are playing
Hopscotch among the landmines.

_Hope has worked miracles before._
If  yours didn't, how can mine?

I could have learned to welcome night,
If only  you had been mine.

_How dare you put words in God's mouth,_
_Shail?_ Why not. He put ashes in mine.
