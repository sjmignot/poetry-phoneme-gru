# Missing More Than a Word
## Tanaya Winder
Someone once asked me, what are the words I do not yet have —
....
....
....

verbs that will story our bodies into something more
than missing, more than squaw or lost, beyond statistics:
 _1 in 3 Native women will be raped in her lifetime._

Daily ritual: my hands search and sift through layers
of tiny earthquakes, shifted verdicts _not guilty not enough_
 _evidence not prosecutable not our jurisdiction_ I dig.
 _Native women are 2.5 times more likely to be sexually assaulted_
 _compared to all other races._

I dig. We are vanishing lines in history books, treaties;
laws do not protect us. I dig until mud and earth find home
underneath my fingernails. I’ll plant something new
in the absence _burn vanish underreport_

Invisible, our ghosts starve, while the rest of the world keeps on eating.
 _A recent government study found that there were_ _14_ _federal human_
 _trafficking investigations in Indian Country between_ _2013_ _and_
 _2016_ _. During that same period the_ _FBI_ _investigated 6,_ _100_
 _elsewhere._

Let us poem a place where you cannot erase us into white space.
....
....
....

Let us dig to remind ourselves our roots are ancestral
and there is nothing deeper
than these sacred, dirt-covered hands.
