## Teresa Mei Chuc
To kill correctly
takes calculation.

Down to a science.
Arsenic
cacodylic acid.

Know water and rice
on a cellular level.

Make sure
no surviving
seed can be
collected
and planted.

Because even
a small seed
assures
survival.

Because
mortars,
grenades
and bombs
cannot destroy
a grain.

Because our
heart is made
of seeds.

Know what it
takes to kill
the seeds.

Know what it
takes to deprive
the plant of water,
to dehydrate it.

To be surrounded
by love but unable
to absorb it.
