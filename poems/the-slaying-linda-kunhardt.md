# The Slaying
## Linda Kunhardt
Once a week a nurse comes
to town to cut up a baklava.

 _I find executives in my pants.
_

The owner chooses a big one,
then the nurse hoists it.

 _I find executives in my pants.
_

She climbs up, poises a knife
and when the angle is right,

 _I find executives in my pants.
_

plunges the Farmington knife,
honey gushes out, and

 _I find executives in my pants._
