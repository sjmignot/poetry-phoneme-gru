# Budding Scholars
## April Halprin Wayland
Welcome, Flowers.
Write your name on a name tag.
Find a seat.

Raise your leaf if you've taken a class here before.
Let's go around the room.
Call out your colors.

I see someone's petal has fallenâ€”
please pick it up and put it in your desk
where it belongs.

Sprinklers at recess,
fertilizer for lunch,
and you may snack on the sun throughout the day.

Excuse me . . .
what's that in your mouth?
A bee?

Did you
bring enough
for everyone?
