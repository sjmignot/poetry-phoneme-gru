Empty air has its own mechanism, _me dijo._
Its gears accord to whim.

We go out only when we have to, _me dijo._
We have hidden things for breathing.

You can't understand it prepped that way, _me dijo._
It always changes, but never readily enough.

Some things we say more of and then again, _me dijo._
They always mean less once pre-written.

The context connections are far too frail, _me dijo._
To make them you need to pixel-point time.

There are no click-in-n-out pictures, _me dijo._
You facet your eyes to see them multiply.

There are hands held out everywhere, _me dijo._
We have to be careful what to step around/in.

Sometimes we come this close too late, _me dijo._
Then we have to wait for inertia to embrace us.

We are the hungry, hungry: so ravenous, _me dijo._
We will tear at your insides and lick them clean.
