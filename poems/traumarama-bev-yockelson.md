# Traumarama!
## Bev Yockelson
my mouth hurts / i’m still dreaming / of hamburgers / of childhood / of the
delicate clacking / of baby teeth / it’s foreign / even when i hold / myself /
i keep tonguing my toothache / ripping the grass from the dirt / and trying to
tie the blades in knots / again / the irritation / the bottle full of milk /
that will always spill / or spoil / sometimes i’m a lover / of my own
dysfunction / sometimes / i list out all the sharp spots / try to floss them
out / mop the spill with paper towel / mail you a postcard / from my mouth /
inscribe it with a paradox / is being full / of cavities / the same as being
empty / or just another iteration / of the holy body
