# These Days It's Hard to Tell What's Part of the Act
## Jennifer Richter
My doctor's packed the place for years
because he's known for making huge things
sometimes disappear. His routine is predictable,
effortless. Pick a number, any number: he's pointing
to his framed pain scale. He pauses for effect.
The six second sequenced faces are a kid—time-lapsed—
at a magic show gone wrong. Onstage in Vegas
once, the rare white tiger snapped. Inexplicable:
my numbers creeping up each week. My doctor
backs out quickly, as if dragged off in some beast's jaws.
