# Dear --
## Donika Kelly
I am not land or timber
nor are you
ocean or celestial body,

but rather we are
the small animals
we have always been.

The land and the sea
know each other
at the threshold

where they meet,
as we know something
of one another,

having shown,
at different times,
some bit of flesh,

some feeling.

We call the showing
 _knowing_ instead of _practice_.
We seem to say,

at different times,
 _A feeling comes_.

What is the metaphor
for two animals
sharing the same space?

 _Marriage?_

We share a practice,
you and I,
a series of postures.

Here is how I
become a tree
[                            ]

and you
[                            ]
a body in space.
