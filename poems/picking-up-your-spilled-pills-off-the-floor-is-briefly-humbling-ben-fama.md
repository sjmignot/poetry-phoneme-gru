# Picking up Your Spilled Pills off the Floor Is Briefly Humbling
## Ben Fama
I was humbled when my boss mocked me

for calling from vacation

I’m broke again

until Friday

from my bed

I see the lights, I see

the party lights

it’s torture

a post-Fordist allegory?

I appropriated a corporate apology

and saved it

in case something happened

but my end date came

and my vacation days paid out

I bought pills

from the intern I’d hired

on my way out

by the seaport

I texted you

we made plans to drink

I like your poochie print workout clothes

the credit card you keep for emergencies

I bought a book

from Strand Annex

though the poetics

weren’t to my taste

later the author died

I was nervous

in those days

always in need

my dark heart, my secret

poetry, my drug-filler

cut into my life and love

that it and I may last
