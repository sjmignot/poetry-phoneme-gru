# Witness
## Philip Lamantia
Because the dark suit is worn it is worn warm
    with a black tie
and a kiss at the head of the stairs

When you hear the dark suit rip
on the heart’s curb the hurt is big
     rose flesh caught on the orange woman’s buttons

As you talk metropole monotone
                  _antique intelligence_
as you dress wounds by peyotl looming the boulevards
women hunt their children from you
who look out
                  lit _still_ inside of a dark suit
