# (The) Abashed
## Evan Kennedy
Danger from others provoked
a change in my internal
law. I was no flawed creature,
but the unpersuaded
sure made their case
with their brutality.
They tied me to a fence, began
thrashing the life out of me.
If the meek deserve
to jubilee, in what bodies
are we to defend our selves
and supple registers
of bonum. It’s time to confess
I was never cruising for
this bruising but maybe
just cruising
toward a rapid intercession
of effervescent affection
that could gift a beneficent
fever among us.


                         Angels arrived to inhospitality,
                         and I hear my body still groan in that aftermath.

I _am_ my desire. Grew up a screw-up
but bucked up a fuck-up,
each thing I took into my nine holes
was rotting, obviously. What perils
when asleep, when en route,
in the sea, in the wilderness
 _somehow I made it through._
When beside myself, I spotted
an antidote toward
a reversal in all places my biology
doomed me.
True witness was clarified
by my thighs, chest, and throat. To
quote that it’s flesh and it’s not—



Now from my
1394 Utah Street room,
a couple of blocks away,
a strangers’ elegy sinks toward
Earth. To keep watch of community
beyond a shame that stills me—
We’ve been put outside
the populace to offset their enmity.

Singing on my way back to
Assisi _a sissy_ , I’m thrown into a ditch.
It’s my bitch of a knee _failing me_
 _after so much cycling_ that groans
as though flesh has worthy feeling.
These thieves think
I’m a rich troubadour, despite
my nasal whine and valedictory hymn—
the one about poverty, or maybe
I am that bad of a mumbler?
Since I’m not much of
a stumbler, it’s a whim to be made
inert through violence _cops not long ago_
 _would round up the likes of me_
 _along Market Street_ so thanks, men,
for making this human a humble
and stilled thing, alive only
unto your forces. Earth will be
a swallower of your corpses.


❖


Made of dirt, would I know what
dirt tastes like. While I was cycling,
the earth and I
exceeded living bodies’ partitions.
Wishing that the strewn parts of
you long gone ones
would reassemble in a gust
of florescence and soundtracks,
I promise my legs can brace
for any supple clamor.
If the dead all rise age thirty,
at twenty-nine,
still ahead is my finest glamour.
Thus I became a hammer
to darkest anti-matter. Thus
I became a ticking time bomb
of kingdom expectation in
my gray hoodie and sharp teeth.

Bring forth any within you to save you.
So made changeless, a wave or nerve
to enact its fullness. If I’m raised
over waste, hold me there to vomit
the meat I’ve sucked down
and peril I’ve soaked in through
local commotion. There is a continent
 _San Francisco_
at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

What is it to be equipping for
the convenience of
kingdom—      such as swapping spit with
strangers, giving dogs a good scratch
behind the ears,
or fighting from my bicycle
the cars that could spell
my death in the papers. And
drinking milkshakes in Mission diners.
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest,
and I threw up at the sight of that.

                         My only security has been to garden civility
                         in city boots scuffled along the way
                         by impedimenta to my solace.
