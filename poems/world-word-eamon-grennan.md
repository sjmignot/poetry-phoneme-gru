# World Word
## Eamon Grennan
What over the gable-end and high up under tangled cloud
           that raven might be saying to its tumble-soaring mate
or what the blackbird might intend when chattering among
           scattered breadcrumbs or what the bellowing of one cow
then another in the near field might mean remains beyond
           my ken—being all noise for which no words will manage
though all is language settling and unsettling the world
           beyond me . . . and yet there’s the dunnock in all its
dun colours at work among the small stones and patchy grass
           of the driveway and here’s the robin’s aggressive tilt
at breadcrumbs and there goes the sudden shriek
           of the blackbird . . . all alive inside the inhuman
breath-pattern of the wind trawling every last leaf
           and blade of grass and flinging rain like velvet pebbles
onto the skylight: nothing but parables in every bristling inch
           of the out-of-sight unspoken never-to-be-known pure
sense-startling untranslatable _there_ of the world as we find it.
