# In the Cold Kingdom

"The younger brother roasted a breast of Pishiboro's
elephant wife and handed Pishiboro some, which he
presently ate. Then the younger brother said in a
voice full of scorn. 'Oh you fool. You lazy man. You
were married to meat and you thought it was a
wife.'"    FROM A MYTH OF THE BUSHMEN
Poised upside down on its duncecap,
a shrunken purple head,
True Blueberry,
enters its tightening frame of orange lip,
and the cream of a child’s cheek is daubed with
Zanzibar Cocoa, while
 _Here at the Martha Washington_
 _Ice Cream Store_
 _we outdo the_ Symbolistes.

Pistachio? Mint Julep?
 _Words have colors,_
 _and colors are tasty._
sweetens his chin.
In front of me Licorice teeters like a lump of coal
on its pinkish base of Pumpkin.
 _A Rauschenberg tongue_
 _fondles this rich_ donnée _,_
 _then begins to erase it._

Turning from all that is present
in the flesh, so to speak,
let the eye wander off to a menu,
where it can start to ingest
“Quite Sour Lemon sherbet
topped with a stem cherry and chocolate sprinkles
     _Swilling in language,_
all floating in bubbly cherry phosphate
 _the bloated imagination_
 _is urged to open still wider_
 _and shovel it in,_
and served with a twist of pretzel.”
In this world “Creamy Vanilla and
Smooth Swiss Chocolate ice creams”
can be “blended with chopped pineapple,
dark fudge sauce, ripe bananas, whipped topping,
cookies, roasted nutmeats and nippy chopped cherries.”
 _the Unconscious, that old hog,_
 _being in charge here of the_
 _creative act._

At about the moment my tastebuds
receive a last tickle of Gingersnap
and begin to respond to
Orange Fudge, I look at you
who have bought my ice cream cones for twenty years,
 _Moving another new ice to the mouth_
 _we needn’t remember_
and look away
 _it is always the same mouth_
 _that melts it._
My mind assembles a ribald tower
of sherbet dips, all on one cone,
Apricot, Apple, Tangerine, Peach, Prune, Lime,
and then it topples.
You are steadier than I.
You order one dip always,
or, in a dish, two dips of the same flavor.

In this hysterical brilliance of neon
 _Come on, consumers,_
 _we’ve got to keep scooping_
it is twelve or fifteen of us
to thirty ice creams.
     _so that the creams shall not rise_
 _like cold lava out of their bins,_
 _numbing our feet, our knees,_
 _freezing our chests, our chins, our eyes,_
Open the door, quick,
and let in two handholding adolescents.
Coping with all those glands
makes them good and hungry.
 _so that, flying out of their cannisters,_
 _the chopped nuts_
 _shall not top off our Technicolor grave_
 _with their oily ashes._

Listen! All around us toothsome cones
are suffering demolition
down to the last, nipple-like tip.
How do we know where to stop?
Perhaps the glasses and dishes
are moulded of candy, and the counters and windows…
 _Over your half-eaten serving of Italian Delight,_
 _why are you looking at_ me
 _the way you are looking at me?_
