# My name came from . . .
## Emmett Tenorio Melendez
My name came from my great-great-great-grandfather.
He was an Indian from the Choctaw tribe.
His name was Dark Ant.
When he went to get a job out in a city
he changed it to Emmett.
And his whole name was Emmett Perez Tenorio.
And my name means:  Ant; Strong; Carry twice
its size.
