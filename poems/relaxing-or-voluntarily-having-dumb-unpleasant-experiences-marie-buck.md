# Relaxing or Voluntarily Having Dumb, Unpleasant Experiences
## Marie Buck
Some people like to relax
and kick back with their friends
just talking and having a drink

which is obviously
highly pleasurable.

Some people like to be entertained
by music or a movie;
some people like to make some jokes
with people they like,
maybe at a bar
or at someone’s house.

Some people like to lay around
with another person,
just touching,

or to prepare food,
alone or with others
while listening to music
that they feel a particular
affinity for.

But sometimes people like to thrust themselves
into the howling wind and snow,
arms tied behind their backs.

I prefer to open my mouth wide open knowing what will happen
if I’m just holding my mouth open,

ready to respond or yell or whatever seems appropriate.

You know, I keep my mouth at the ready to make a lot of noise.

And sometimes it becomes filled
with hard packed snow or with sand,

sand being more of a problem,
since, you know,
it won’t melt.
