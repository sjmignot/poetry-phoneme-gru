# Logic
## Alice Notley
It was a poem
men took because it said  _ovary_

didn’t take my
political poems
they took the one that said  _ovary_

Are you sure it was because it
           said  _ovary_?

Yes, for them that’s  _logical._

\---------------------------

Destroy another
          city
What
else
is war for? So

you’ll go down
each of you does. dies in
                           whirlwind

each of you who does, dies
          paying
for the pain you experience
         Just that
and nothing is established

Because I am a woman
Cutting as many cords
as tie you to me. this isn’t
           anarchy
it isn’t anything you
           could name

You’re still here
without ties?

because they were  _logical._

 __ _\---------------------------_

Dance little asshole dance
oh he gets elected, like a Calvinist
He says, I have these guts
Men, I have these guts.

\---------------------------

Having dedicated whole
regions to the destruction
          you inspire, the
logic will be to go on doing it
doing it. Having proceeded by

the logic
         of your per-
sonal vaccuum
you will perceive your continued
          lightlessness
as an excuse to go on. having
gone on
as you have. And so one continues.

\-----------------------------

Lead the boy out of
          the building on fire
his head twisted
          upwards
all fucked

What else is there to
       know if
one has gotten
twisted up
all fucked

he is a screaming fire

\-----------------------------

In the explanations
of our lives’ experience

they’ve left out this wild moment
the long mirror on the right-hand wall of the
corridor suddenly shattered
I can’t see myself anymore.

\-----------------------------

I repeat that I am not frightened
          and why not
I don’t know
what my reactions
are supposed to be.

\-----------------------------

        “Please tell me something
with which I’m familiar.”

isn’t there another part of now
