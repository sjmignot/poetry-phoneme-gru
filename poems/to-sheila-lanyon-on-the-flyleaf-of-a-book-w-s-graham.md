# [To Sheila Lanyon, on the Flyleaf of a Book]
## W. S. Graham
Sheila, we speak here on the fly
Leaf of a book which was myself
     A good few graves ago.
Now I am maintained by other
Words for better or for worse
     To whisper my hello.

The seasons turn. Threshold on thresh
Hold forms continually and falls
     Under grief’s lonely hammer.
What did you say? I thought between
These fly leaf words I heard you speak
     Out of your Second Summer.

The summer chimes and turns its blue
Dragon-flying eyes to see
     We two are not afraid.
Hello, Sheila, I can hear
Your breath on the other side of the word
     And see you turn your head.
