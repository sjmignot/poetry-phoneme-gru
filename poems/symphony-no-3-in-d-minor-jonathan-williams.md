# Symphony No.3, in D Minor
## Jonathan Williams
Thousands lavishing, thousands starving;
intrigues, war, flatteries, envyings,
hypocrisies, lying vanities, hollow amusements,
exhaustion, dissipation, death--and giddiness
and laughter, from the first scene to the last.
--Samuel Palmer, 1858
_I. Pan Awakes: Summer Marches In_


               Pan’s
               spring rain
               “drives his victims
               out to the animals
               with whom they become
               as one”—

               pain and paeans,
               hung in the mouth,

               to be sung


                _II. What the Flowers in the Meadow Tell Me_


               June 6, 1857, Thoreau in his _Journal:_

               _A year is made up of a certain series_
 _and number of sensations and thoughts_
 _which have their language in nature…_

 _Now I am ice, now_
 _I am sorrel._


               Or, Clare, 1840, Epping Forest:

 _I found the poems in the fields_
 _And only wrote them down_

               and

                _The book I love is everywhere_
 _And not in idle words_

               John, _claritas_ tell us the words are _not_ idle,
               the syllables are able
               to turn plantains into quatrains,
              tune _raceme_ to _cyme, panicle_ and _umbel_ to
              form corollas in light clusters of tones…

               Sam Palmer hit it:
               “Milton, by one epithet
               draws an oak of the largest girth I ever saw,
               ‘Pine and _monumental_ oak’:
               I have just been trying to draw a large one in
               Lullingstone; but the poet’s tree is huger than
               any in the park.”

               Muse in a meadow, compose in
               a mind!


               III. _What the Animals in the Forest Tell Me_


               Harris’s Sparrow—

               103 species seen
               by the Georgia Ornithological Society
               in Rabun Gap,

               including Harris’s Sparrow, with its
               black crown, face, and bib encircling
               a pink bill


               It was, I think, the third sighting
               in Georgia, and I should have been there
               instead of reading Clare, listening to
               catbirds and worrying about
 _Turdus migratorious_ that flew
               directly into the Volkswagen and
               bounced into a ditch


               Friend Robin, I cannot figure it, if I’d
               been going 40 you might be
               whistling in some grass.

               10 tepid people got 10 stale letters
               one day earlier,
               I cannot be happy
               about that.


               IV. _What the Night Tells Me_


               the dark drones on
               in the southern wheat fields
               and the hop flowers
               open before the sun’s
               beckoning


               the end
               is ripeness, the wind
               rises,
               and the dawn says
               yes


               YES! it says
               “yes”



               V. _What the Morning Bells Tell Me_


 _Sounds, and sweet aires_
 _that give delight_
 _and hurt not—_

               that, let
               Shakespeare’s
               delectation
               bear us



               VI. _What Love Tells Me_



               Anton Bruckner counts the 877th leaf
               on a linden tree in the countryside near Wien
               and prays:

               Dear God, Sweet Jesus,
               Save Us, Save Us…

               the Light in the Grass,
               the Wind on the Hill,

               are in my head,
               the world cannot be heard


               Leaves obliterate
               my  heart,

               we touch each other
               far apart…


               Let us count
               into
               the Darkness
