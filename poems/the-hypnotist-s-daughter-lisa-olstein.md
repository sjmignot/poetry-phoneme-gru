# The Hypnotist's Daughter
## Lisa Olstein
At the London Zoo a toddler falls over the rail
of the Primate World _only if you close your eyes_

and a female gorilla comes to sit by, to circle
her long dark arm around him _only this one time_

while the others stay away. The zookeeper says
she lost a baby earlier this year _only just barely_

and they’ve been waiting months for her tits to dry.
The boy’s mother watches from above

 _only when I say so_ the thirty minutes it takes
the right person to lower the right ladder down

 _only as a last resort._ In the interim a newscaster
whose station carries it live _only if you promise
_

not to let go reports that dolphins and sometimes
certain whales rescue people stranded at sea

 _only when I close my eyes_ lift them to the air
when they need breathing or swim them close enough

to land. In the interim I imagine the span of time
from when the smooth hard snout finds me

and begins to push _only if you promise not to tell_
to when we come into view of a shore _only this once_

any shore. In the interim I pray for what should come
to come. I pray for the cat to come out from under

the floorboards _only every once in a while_ to come
down from the tall maple, to come back alive

 _only if you say so_ in one piece, still in her collar.
I pray to be saved, to be sent far away, to be

allowed to just stay home _only another month or two_
just stay home and erase the objects in each room

with my mind while holding them in my hands
 _only a matter of time now._ I do want to hold them

in my hands, to hold them to my lungs by way
of deep breath _only since July_ and a deeper sense

of inhalation. I pray for you _only just this once_
to press out from the small veins at the back of my eyes

 _only you_ back out into the world. I pray for you
to come and sit by me _only a few more minutes now._
