# Of a Lack in Our Administrations
## Hannah Brooks-Motl
In all this system I watched a cloud fall
Carted wet down the design
Need is a big pool
Lo go its creaturely waves

Commerce came open and bright like a starfuck
"I hear, with great shame for our century"
Last zing on the stairs

"So-and-so wants company to Paris; so-and-so is looking for a
          servant with such-and-such qualifications"

Execution too diddled back then

"So-and-so wants a master"
