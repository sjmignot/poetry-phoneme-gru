# "From the Sustaining Air"
## Larry Eigner
from the sustaining air

fresh air

There is the clarity of a shore
And shadow,   mostly,   brilliance

summer
                the billows of August

When, wandering, I look from my page

I say nothing

      when asked

I am, finally, an incompetent, after all
