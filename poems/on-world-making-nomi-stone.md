# On World-Making
## Nomi Stone
To love is to tell the story of the world.     There was
an ocean with a boat     mountains     a meadow     too painful to stare
at directly. Haven’t I been here before? Yes.     No:     not quite here.

“It is not as if,” the philosopher writes, “an _I_ exists
independently over here and then simply loses a _you_ over there.”
In the mist, a man rigs the _Suzelle_ , little red boat.
 _Loved_ labored for months, learning to tie the right knot. The exact

and only knot that will keep the vessel tethered. She rehearsed
for the worst possible thing. “The attachment to _you_ ,” it is written,
“is part of what composes who _I_ am.” I know/knew
those hands, hers. I watched her dust the sourdough with flour

at midnight a moon between her fingers.     Gone
went _Loved_. But the half-world of her in me
was me.     It was lit by the moon.
