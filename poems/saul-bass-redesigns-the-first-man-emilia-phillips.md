I want to make beautiful things, even if nobody cares.
To make, you first have
            to create materials. Re: man, we know
the rib removed. But, _before_ — ?
            Forget _ash to ash, dust_
 _ &_c.

                        Stick a floating rib (i.e. thoracic
11–12, y’know — “Edenic”) in a glass
            of  water with the promise
                        it’ll grow
            roots like leek or fur

                        like chia. The joke’s Crusoe
            astride the bone or   Jim _&_ Huck paddling
rustic as a ballpoint pen will go.
            —  _Nn-_ o.
 _(That’s not a plank
_
 __ ____ in your peeper!) —

           It’s a hollow; _cue_ : running

faucet, a Pabst-crack opening
                      into seraphic
           choir. (Risk Handel’s?
   A perfect major? root, third, _&_ fifth?) With aesthetics,
                      like a bad comb-

                                            over, you don’t
           need a mirror to know what you are
   missing. Now that you have this
                                 thing, you’ve got to

   feed, roof, _&_ rock-

                      a-bye baby. You’re the big boss, head honch-

    o, but watch out, foreman, Little Evie
_ &_ Adam were the first
organized union. ( _1-2-3-4_ _..._ _don’t give us pain in labor!_ )

                      So what’ll you give him in return?

    Latin and genus?
                      Genius?
                                            . . .  Medicinal plants?

                      ( _I call this “Vladimir
_
                                 Nabo-cough,” _man_ _._ )

Or do we let him take for him-
           self   by fount,
_fin_ , _&_ medium — language. Though from this,
                      we know
           creation is only

myth; destruction, narrative.
