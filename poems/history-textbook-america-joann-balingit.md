# History Textbook, America
## JoAnn Balingit
I'd search for Philippines in History class.
The index named one page, moved on to Pierce.
 _The Making of America_ marched past
my enigmatic father's place of birth.
The week he died some man we didn't know
called up. _This is his brother,_ one more shock,
 _phoning for him._ "He died three days ago."
The leaden black receiver did not talk.
My uncle never gave his name or town,
we never heard from him. Was it a dream?
The earpiece roar dissolved to crackling sounds,
a dial tone erased the Philippines.
And yet my world grows huge with maps, crisscrossed,
my History alive with all I've lost.
