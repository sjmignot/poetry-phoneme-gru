# crossing the South China Sea as analgesia
## Quan Barry
One day we will all be like this—the boat’s sickening pitch, & the
delicateness
     needless, consumable.

How everything here naturally passes into night, a room
     w/o walls.

Could mindlessness keep us alive? Could bright colors?

Tonight I am thinking of the young woman who dreams of her father
     being shot in the head. Imagine needing to believe the one you love
     has been destroyed.

Now it is after midnight—the spindrift lunar & diaphanous. Here alone on deck
     could I make peace w/it all in thirty seconds—the water’s inherent
rising, the gasping
     for air?

I have never seen such omnipresence, such vast dreamlessness—
     but I too am such things.

What does it mean to be eroded? What would be the significance of slipping one
leg
     over the rail & straddling the indifference?

Yes. Once upon a time we spent three days on a boat out of Kobé, Japan.

All night the waves. All night the somnambulistic urges.

Or how as children we would swim in a hard rain—the lake’s surface ragged &
torn,
     but underneath

the roots of the water lilies like ladders
     trailing down into the marvelous.
