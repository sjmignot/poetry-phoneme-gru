# The Arrivals
## Anne Kennedy
When we arrive at the lounge of everything
with our bags
handfuls of earth     the lives of our grandparents
in our memory devices
we expect an exchange of sorts     that is what
we expect
and I think everyone deep down expects
that we will not turn back
Through a high window we will connect stars
like line drawings
translate the sparkles of the poet
we will
sign the fascinating mouth of the speaker
we will sing
lyrics that someone thought were pretty good
we will sing them
and we will not turn back     we will not

When our footsteps awaken fresh
from a long
complicated journey during which the planet
slid otherwise
we will likely remember a dream we had once
and tell
a version of it to the next person and the next
and realize hopefully
they also have a dream to tell and we will not
do that thing
where we won’t listen to anyone else’s dream
we will listen
and interpret     signing     singing     saying
even though
we have been instructed not to use ings
we will use
the wisdom disseminated by our devices
we will not turn back

we will not
If on arrival there is wringing of hands
we will shake hands
and in the eye of a storm we will make tea
with our brilliant
fading bodies we will do a variety of things
while we can
we will bed down on the steps of the assembly
if we have to
we will bed down in a court of law
and all beds
anyway are temporary and when we see
that
and realize we have traveled through the night
we have traveled
and are not turning back     that
will be the point
at which we will arrive
