# even tho yr sampler broke down on you
## Ntozake Shange
magnolias & forsythia blossom
from yr Sugar Hill/ Ray Drummond
plays nasty riffs & i imagine
alla the Palm Cafe turns out
when you glow at dusk on
Convent Avenue/ slidin easily by
the just-for-us propositions Gylan Kain
fashioned at every other Harlem corner/
we usedta leave deluxe issues of
love potions/ remedies even insinuations
danglin from Baptist steeples/ Methodist steps
jump back/ jump up/ beatin down/ flyin
yng wenches whose skirts still
tease solos over to the Savoy/

        (you cd make yrself irresistible/ be my
            Willis Avenue Bridge/ floatin/ Rican wet
                _su lengua dulce_ / over an East River of
                 gardenias/ remember the minor sixth)
you hummed to me while I was
reachin for the/ ceilin/ where our
folks was carryin on before Michelangelo
or Lionel Richie/ some where round there
where you brush up gainst baobabs/ well
                 (you know where my beauty marks are/ all
over
HARLEM)
we sing like flowers/ i see
round brown honies giggle at us/ the
silly/ niggahness of yr quick light
kisses/ _cómo_ fresh/ _mi chabalo negro_ / _mi propio_ Tito
Puente/
       my own rhythm section/ that petal
   opening every time yr lips/ let
love/ _cada vez_ / yr lips
let love fall/ all
over
Sugar Hill
