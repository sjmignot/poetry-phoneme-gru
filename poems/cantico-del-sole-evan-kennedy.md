# Cantico del Sole
## Evan Kennedy
let through praise while cycling
—a hill or shop to match you—
the shining bay
the foggy gray
beneath all names and phrases


let through praise while working
—a bird or book to watch you—
the formal sun
the queerer ones
lifting their heads to face you


let through praise while flirting
—a storm or song to patch you—
the iced-down bruise
the new black shoes
and all the things that make you


let praise through earthly city
—a sibling glad to catch us—
the blameless meek
the faceless deep
please mind your house and graces
