# From "Loss"
## David Harsent
IX

If it became impossible to touch and be touched, to see
and be seen, to love and trade ecstasy for risk where risk
is ecstasy, to be hidden in plain view, to be perfectly lost
which means lost to the world, lying side-by-side arms linked
in a bond so intricate it could never unfold or break—
If it became crucial to live out of sight, to be housebound,
to walk a beaten path in the garden, to sit at the window
blurred by rainfall, to sit barred and blocked, books
set aside that would never be read, rolling news of flash flood
and fire, angels treading the updraft, a chaos of voices—
If dreams should give the rest of it: the path in the garden
going underground, flood and fire as God’s only gift
the house holding its secrets, that pattern of locked rooms,
what lies outside (voices: angels) crowding the perimeter—


You could make an installation of it
(and why not?) on a bare floor
in a bare hall under neon strip:
what seems thrown down what seems
heap after heap of discards but is not:
hair and shoes and spectacles
and clothes (teeth also saved)
repetition such that it blurs
images folding into one another
abstract, just shape being evident
except this shoe except
this lens catching the light which is
error or artifact, something like
iron litter carefully thrown down
by Joseph Beuys but more the bright
grotesque of Bacon’s _Fragment_ ,
of Dubuffet’s _L’Arbre de fluides_ ,
what’s torn what’s wrenched apart ...
Heap after heap, grainy footage
of a cattle train snowscape
smokestacks, scratch orchestra, what
more do you need ... dogs ... what more
do you need of this: the train
all but silent in snow, footage
of carcasses thrown down naked,
you could make a montage of it:
quick hands, a low sun deepening
to yellow by trees and towers,
the way shadows are cast, the light
you need, the shapes you need
a sureness of touch to bring it all
together, perhaps a light box
fragments and fractures backlit
and all of a piece not least
the new dead: they lie
in a scatter, your focal point
they make sudden broken
angels in the snow.
Fool steps up. His art is palimpsest.
He’ll tag your work: spray-paint
a ditzy orange bug-eyed frog
at the door of the charnel house
color the snowscape blue, redact
the chimneys, configure the train
with silver-and-black chevrons:
a snake drawn up to the iron gate,
his artwork: _Evil is as evil does._
The frog spits bile. The snake
is hollow-eyed. He adds
speech bubbles to the cold still air:
“Hosanna Hosanna Ho—sa— _nna_ ”:


Children in a pool of light, a pool of dust; the way
images deceive, the way time shunts and stalls, a test
of what gathers and corrupts, what will not stay
as words unspeak, as children are lost to light and dust.
