# Origami
## Joyce Sutphen
It starts
with a blank sheet,
an undanced floor,

air where no sound
erases the silence.
As soon as

you play the first note,
write down a word,
step onto the empty stage,

you've moved closer
to the creature inside.
Rememberâ€”

a square
can end up as frog, cardinal,
mantis, or fish.

You can make
what you want,
do what you wish.
