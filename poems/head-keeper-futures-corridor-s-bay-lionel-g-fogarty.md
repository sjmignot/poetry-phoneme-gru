# Head Keeper Futures Corridor's Bay
## Lionel G. Fogarty
Every sand rushes the beaches are first people’s
museum ample by laughter original (overseers)
things must change where names are forgiven
ports shores bays renamed won’t hurt the
truth for children histories futures.
The mouth who named mountains for brainwave
oversea shook weekage house living, stay by a dead cold rotten lie.
Whitefellas must derigetter their conzinerices atturies.
Beach have turn not by your Scotland bream them down under sir Scot cos you’ve
stole Blackfellas alots.
Homestead will fall again for huppy Yumbas,
gaining restored trust to not live in past.
Telegraphic Aborigines were always in first port worlds.
Aquarium birds mammals sing now,
tell us substantial ramps up on the banks that flanked the dreamers times
occupants.
Nature rates over new buildings.
New names for the city towns not virgin bush inkeep as the real keeper
are watching every development.
Renames IDs of all needs domain
pleasant rebirth to grow majority.
First houses were here by natives nice and right to season
changing by dreaming winds rain hot people’s names ...
Dromana man reclaim names first foremost.
