# son/daughter
## Kai Conradi
In a dream my dad fell

      from the top of a steep       white       mountain

            down       into a blue       crevasse
            like the space between       two waves
            where the light       shines through       just enough
            to tell you
            you will miss this life dearly.

              The falling took years.

              I could hear him moving through air       and then finally
nothing.


In another dream       my dad was an angel

      his see-through body dangling in the air

              floating above me       face shimmery like tinfoil

                     and I cried and cried when he told me

                     _I can’t come back to earth now       not ever_.




When my dad told me

_You will always be my daughter_

maybe it was like that.



                                                                         Will
I be allowed to come back to earth

                                                                         and
be your son?
