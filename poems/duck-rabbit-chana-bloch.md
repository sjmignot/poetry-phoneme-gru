# Duck/Rabbit
## Chana Bloch
We remember the rabbit when we see
the duck, but we cannot experience
both at the same time

_WHAT do you remember?_ When I looked at
his streaky glasses, I wanted
to leave him. _And before that?_ He stole those
cherries for me at midnight. We were walking
in the rain and I loved him.
 _And before that?_ I saw him coming
toward me that time at the picnic,
edgy, foreign.
 __
_But you loved him?_ He sat in his room with
the shades drawn, brooding. _But you_
 _loved him?_ He gave me
a photo of himself at sixteen, diving
from the pier. It was summer. His arms
outstretched. _And before that?_
His mother was combing his soft curls
with her fingers and crying. Crying.
 __
_Is that what he said?_ He put on the straw hat
and raced me to the barn. _What did he_
 _tell you?_ Here’s the dried rose, brown
as tobacco. Here’s the letter that I tore
and pasted. The book of blank pages
with the velvet cover. _But do you still_
 __
_love him?_ When I rub the nap
backwards, the colors lift,
bristle. _What do you mean?_
Sometimes, when I’m all alone,
I find myself stroking it.
