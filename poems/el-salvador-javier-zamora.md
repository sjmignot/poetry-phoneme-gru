# El Salvador
## Javier Zamora
Salvador, if I return on a summer day, so humid my thumb
will clean your beard of  salt, and if  I touch your volcanic face,

kiss your pumice breath, please don’t let cops say: _he’s gangster_.
Don’t let gangsters say: _he’s wrong barrio_. Your barrios

stain you with pollen, red liquid pollen. Every day cops
and gangsters pick at you with their metallic beaks,

and presidents, guilty. Dad swears he’ll never return,
Mom wants to see her mom, and in the news:

every day black bags, more and more of us leave. Parents say:
 _don’t go; you have tattoos. It’s the law; you don’t know_

 _what law means there_. ¿But what do they know? We don’t
have greencards. Grandparents say: _nothing happens here_.

Cousin says: _here, it’s worse. Don’t come, you could be_     ...
Stupid Salvador, you see our black bags,

our empty homes, our fear to say: _the war has never stopped,_
and still you lie and say: _I’m fine, I’m fine,_

but if  I don’t brush Abuelita’s hair, wash her pots and pans,
I cry. Like tonight, when I wish you made it

easier to love you, Salvador. Make it easier
to never have to risk our lives.
