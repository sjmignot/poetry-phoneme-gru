# Ode to Autocorrect
## Martha Silano
Because it changes O’Hare to o hate,
o hate, o hate — over and over, no matter
how many times I retype it. O hate, like

an American tune, an American fable
where, yo, you can enter an o hate
bathroom, take a selfie in the mirror

cuz your sister wants to see the pockets
of your Great American Rhinestone Jeans.
Because, on a street called Viewpoint,

 _I get home_ becomes _I get guns_ , off a road
on a mission to kill every squirrel-ish
pedestrian. Because he was packing,

concealed, threatening to use it, use
his hands or feet. _My feet_ , iamb
of a son of a birch, of a brick chatting

with the devil, with God, with a listener
not listening. Because he’d gone bonnets,
his garden bounty a faded wine, his wife’s

linguine a longing for a golden ear,
so I took her to the botanical gardens
in my getaway car, to a fruit on a vine,

but the limes went lemur, the night to nonfat,
the clear to catastrophic. Because driving away
from the _frog man_ croaking hypocrite,

 _heavenly_ went down like a melting hedge,
a gal gone hog-tied, a fish crying, a tiger-
tiger togetherness, flight or fucked,

a heart, stroked, racing to its vicarious
carousel, a fungus lashed to a beam gone
beleaguered. Because he will kill her,

that’s his plan: to kill us all. Can’t commit
or commute, can’t debone his breath,
can’t take his acute paranoia, chalk it up

to cute. Because this here’s a Josie
madhouse, a bedroom bedrock-locked.
Because _Blvd_ morphed to _Bled_ , spirit

summoned with a Ouija board. Because
 _soap holder_ went _love hen_ , though love
had flown the Calycanthus

like the grilled portobellos messing
with his vowels. Please _please_ , I pleaded
to the pleading day. Because prayer

is like a bread line, a penny for your
exploded mind. Because _lots of logs
_
to you, ma, because _so sorry_ went  _poem_.
