# Flying Lesson
## Dolores Hayden
Focus on the shapes. _Cirrus_ , a curl,
 _stratus_ , a layer, _cumulus_ , a heap.

 _Humilis_ , a small cloud,
 _cumulus humilis_ , a fine day to fly.

 _Incus_ , the anvil, stay grounded.
 _Nimbus_ , rain, be careful,

don’t take off near _nimbostratus_ ,
a shapeless layer

of  rain, hail, ice, or snow.
Ice weighs on the blades of  your propeller,

weighs on the entering edge of your wings.
Read a cloud,

decode it,
a dense, chilly mass

can shift, flood with light.
Watch for clouds closing under you,

the sky opens in a breath,
shuts in a heartbeat.
