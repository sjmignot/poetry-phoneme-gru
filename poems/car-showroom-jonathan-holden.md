# Car Showroom
## Jonathan Holden
Day after day, along with his placid
automobiles, that well-groomed
sallow young man had been waiting for
me, as in the cheerful, unchanging
weather of a billboard—pacing
the tiles, patting his tie, knotting, un-
knotting the façade of his smile
while staring out the window.
He was so bad at the job
he reminded me of myself
the summer I failed
at selling _Time_ and _Life_ in New Jersey.
Even though I was a boy
I could feel someone else’s voice
crawl out of my mouth,
spoiling every word,
like this cowed, polite kid in his tie
and badge that said _Greg_ ,
saying _Ma’am_ to my wife, calling
me _Sir_ , retailing the air with such piety
I had to find anything out the window.
Maybe the rain.  It was gray
and as honestly wet as ever.  Something
we could both believe.
