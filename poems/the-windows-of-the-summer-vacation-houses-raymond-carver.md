# The Windows of the Summer Vacation Houses

### 1985

They withheld judgement, looking down at us
silently, in the rain, in our little boat —
as three lines went into the dark water
for salmon. I'm talking about the Hood Canal
in March, when the rain won't let up.
Which was fine by me. I was happy
to be on the water trying out
new gear. I heard of the death,
by drowning, of a man I didn't know.
And the death in the woods of another,
hit by a snag. *They don't call them
widow-makers for nothing.*
Hunting stories of bear,
elk, deer, cougar—taken in and out
of season. More hunting stories.
Women, this time. And this time
I could join in. It used to be girls.
Girls of 15, 16, 17, 18—and we
the same age. Now it was women. And married
women at that. No longer girls. Women.
Somebody or other's wife. The mayor
of this town, for instance. His wife.
Taken. The deputy sheriff's wife, the same.
*But he's an asshole anyway.*
Even a brother's wife. *It's not anything
to be proud of, but somebody had to go
and do his homework for him*. We caught
two small ones, and talked a lot, and laughed.
But as we turned in to the landing
a light went on in one of those houses
where nobody was supposed to be.
Smoke drifted up from the chimney
of this place we'd looked at as empty.
And suddenly, like that—I remembered Maryann.

When we were both young.
The rare coin of those mint days!
It was there and gone
by the time we hooked the boat to the trailer.
But it was something to recall.
It turned dark as I watched the figure
move to stand at the window and look

down. And I knew then those things that happened
so long ago must have happened, but not
to us. No, I don't think peoplecould go on living
if they had lived those things. It couldn't
have been us.

The people I'm talking about—I'm sure
I must have read about somewhere.
They were not the main characters, no,
as I'd thought at first and for a long
while after. But some others you
sympathized with, even loved, and cried for—
just before they were taken away
to be hangd, or put somwhere.

We drove off without looking back
at the houses. Last night
I cleaned fish in the kitchen.

This morning it was still dark
when I made coffee. And found blood
on the porcelain sides of the sink.
More blood on the counter. A trail
of it. Drops of blood on the bottom
of the refrigerator where the fish
lay wrapped and gutted.
Everywhere this blood. Mingling with thoughts
in my mind of the time we'd had —
that dear wife, and I.
