# Craw
## Atsuro Riley
Split the boy       —his thorax, throat
Pierce-peel the craw:

A jag-crystalled crust      —his black scoria, slag
(not _Bulb after Bulb, in Silver rolled_ )

What no gizzard ground (could hope to grind)
What would not mesh
What would not smelt

Embedded undigested there in meat
