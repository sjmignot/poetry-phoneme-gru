# Girl Soup
## Sawako Nakayasu
I get tired of being the one to make all the decisions so when they ask me
where I want to eat, I say that I don’t care, I’d eat anything   at this
point. Next thing I know, I am face to face with a bowl of Girl Soup and I
just can’t bring myself. Some of us at the table are in a hurry to eat the
soup, they are specifically trying to eat the  girls quickly because they seem
to know that if you wait too long they turn into cyborgs or robots, and those
are harder to chew. I can see that some of the girls are still alive and
perhaps would like to be extracted from the soup, but when I squint I see that
there are girls all over the floor with varying amounts of soup clinging to
their clothes (you didn’t think they were naked, did you?) and so there goes
that idea. Just at the moment I think I am running out of options, something
comes over me and I take a deep breath and I do it, I jump right in there,
that bowl of Girl Soup, no one is checking IDs or questioning my size or
gender or race or voter affiliation, and I quick round up all the girls in the
bowl into a large huddle. We have now obliterated two major problems: huddled
together we are too large to eat, and also we’ve taken care of the problem of
the eater.
