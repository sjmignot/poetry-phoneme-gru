# The end of the world
## Miroslav Holub
The bird had come to the very end of its song
and the tree was dissolving under its claws.

And in the sky the clouds were twisting
and darkness flowed through all the cracks
into the sinking vessel of the landscape.

Only in the telegraph wires
a message still
crackled:

C-.-o---m--e. h...o---m--e.
y-.--o---u..- h...a.-v...-e.
a.-s...o---n-.
