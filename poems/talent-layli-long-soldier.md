## Layli Long Soldier
my first try I made a hit it dropped from morning gray the smallest shadow
both wings slipped
inward mid-flight the man barked _Now_ I shot again and again a third time
with each arrow
through the target I thought was it luck or was it skill luck or skill as the
last one fell


its awkward shape made me run there pulsing on the ground I was astounded by
its size a
gangly white goose throbbed heaved its head my eyes dropped blood flowers
opened in the
snow of its neck behind my should stepping down from a yellow bus


child made their way across the field I shot once more to end it quickly close
range its death
did I do this to spare the bird from suffering or to spare the children the
sight my motives in
humid cold yes my knuckles in the cold steamed bright red


because on my stomach in grass in rubber boots pockets and vests I slid along
with that hunter I
did as he directed from quiver my draw my black lashes in steely eyed release
it felt good there
it felt strong my breath in autumn was an animal there I thought did I really
do this        did _I_
really yet what difference is muscle is an arrow powered upward or any flight
to center when I
did not hear it though I clearly mouthed _poor thing poor thing poor thing_
