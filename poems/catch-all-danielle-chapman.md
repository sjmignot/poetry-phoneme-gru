# Catch-All
## Danielle Chapman
Mother Dear, never apologize for nettles
I yanked in fury
from Lottie Shoop’s side yard —

they stung me into seeing
fairy mosses lilypad
her middened juniper,

the quivering gobble of her chin,
teacup clicking dentures as she sprang
up into her wattle hut
and broke a rib

of aloe vera —
gel belling the top of that claw goblet.

It didn’t cool the sting, and yet, noticing
sunshine thumbing plums in a string
catch-all —

I was already well.
