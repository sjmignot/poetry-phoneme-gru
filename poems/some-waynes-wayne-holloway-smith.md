# Some Waynes
## Wayne Holloway-Smith
Magic Wayne with flowers; Wanye West; Box-of-Tricks Wayne; Wayne sad on
Facebook, proving he loves his daughter; the sporty Wayne — loves himself
skinny; Bald Wayne, head like a rocking chair; Amy Waynehouse; Wayne the
ironic; Fat Wayne — tits pushed beneath a Fred Perry Wayne; Wayne from near
Slough; Ugly Wayne — the unlikely mess of his wife Wayne — canned laughter;
Wayne who renamed another Wayne Fleabag; Track-suited Wayne — your hubcaps,
his pockets; Home and A-Wayne; Randy Wayne; Wayne, fountains of him, every
drop snug to someone’s mum; Wayne, boyfriend of Stacey; Wayne-ker; Wayne the
rap star, gold teeth, grime; Wayne the Superhero, Wayne the Cowboy; Dancing
Wayne — in tights; It’s-Wayning-Men; a cavalcade of Waynes fucking each other
up in a Geoff Hattersley poem — in a pub, in Barnsley; Purple Wayne; Wayne’s
World Wayne; Wayne “Sleng Teng” Smith; A-Wayne in a Manger; all of them have
stopped what they’re doing, all of them divided in two rows and facing each
other, all of them, arms raised, they are linking fingers, all of them: an
architrave through which  I celebrate, marching like I am the bridegroom,
grinning like I am the bride
