# The Reductions
## Rebecca Wolff
Let’s go out and buy something. In the sun.

No, let’s stay home and make something, the sun floods the room. It
could be green, on paper. It could be money. That’s the way to create
new matter.

That’s how I detach boats from moorings—my boat, my mooring—
     the harbor
shallow in low tide

skiff propelled over buffeting sands flats on

sheer
puissance.
