# Spring and All: XI [In passing with my mind]
## William Carlos Williams
In passing with my mind
on nothing in the world

but the right of way
I enjoy on the road by

virtue of the law        —
I saw

an elderly man who
smiled and looked away

to the north past a house —
a woman in blue

who was laughing and
leaning forward to look up

into the man’s half
averted face

and a boy of eight who was
looking at the middle of

the man’s belly
at a watchchain —

The supreme importance
of this nameless spectacle

sped me by them
without a word —

Why bother where I went ?
for I went spinning on the

four wheels of my car
along the wet road until

I saw a girl with one leg
over the rail of a balcony
