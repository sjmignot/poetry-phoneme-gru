# Mrs G. Watters
## Frank Ormsby
The letters still come for Mrs Watters,
who must, at one time, have warmed this house
and lived as we do. Mostly small matters —

the rolled calendar that, had she stayed,
might hang now where I drew the rusted nail,
the catalogues, the last gas bill unpaid —

and always _Mrs_ Watters. So for me
the spirit of the house is feminine,
its whisper of the one who, constantly,

draws letters that assume she has never gone.
On which I weekly write, without conviction:
'No longer living here. Address unknown.'
