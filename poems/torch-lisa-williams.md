                                      when I beheld a fire
win out against a hemisphere of shadows.
                           --Inferno, Dante (tr. by Allen Mandelbaum)
If I could hold a fire against
a hemisphere of shadows, hold it
close, not so that damage
finds my hands, but so fire scatters
galvanizing strands, my pupils
responsive to the flamesâ€™ unbridled
tutelage as they tell me
 _nothing but these little jumps
_
out of your definitions, small
or large or leaping, sinking, slumped...
If I could hold a fire against
that latticework of shadows, standing
close to flames pivoting without
being singed or riveted or convinced
it is the only spirit, like a god,
making me something nailed to wood
then keep my head, then coolly draw
some backbone from that dazzle.
