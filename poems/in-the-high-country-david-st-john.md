# In the High Country
## David St. John
Some days I am happy to be no one
The shifting grasses

In the May winds are miraculous enough
As they ripple through the meadow of lupine

The field as iridescent as a Renaissance heaven
 _&_ do you see that boy with his arms raised

Like one of Raphael’s angels held within
This hush _&_ this pause _&_ the sky’s lapis expanse?

That boy is my son _&_ I am his only father
Even when I am no one
