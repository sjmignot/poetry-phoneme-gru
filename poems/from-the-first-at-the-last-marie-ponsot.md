# From "The First, at the Last"
## Marie Ponsot
All he undertook
goes under, under
the undergrowth he rose from
fly-boy, lovely
in his day.
All his clothes
— spruce suit _&_ tie —
are underclothes
against ungrounded gray.
All his studies understudy
an unstudied play.

          _Under the under
_
          of what I remember
          we are both twenty
          and except with each other
          underemployed.

 _It is summer.
_
                Under our butter, bread,
                summer’s hunger satisfied.
