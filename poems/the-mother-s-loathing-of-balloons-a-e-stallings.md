# The Mother's Loathing of Balloons
## A. E. Stallings
I hate you,
How the children plead
At ﬁrst sight—

 _I want, I need_ ,
I hate how nearly
Always I

At ﬁrst say _no_ ,
And then comply.
(Soon, soon

They will grow bored
Clutching _your
_
Umbilical cord)—

Over the moon,
Lighter-than-air,
Should you come home,

They’d cease to care—
Who tugs you through
The front door

On a leash, won’t want you
Anymore
And will forget you

On the ceiling—
Admittedly,
A giddy feeling—

Later to ﬁnd you,
Puckered, small,
Crouching low

Against the wall.
O thin-of-skin
And ﬁt to burst,

You break for her
Who wants you worst.
Your forebear was

The sack of the winds,
The boon that gives
And then rescinds,

Containing nothing
But the force
That blows everyone

Off course.
Once possessed,
Your one chore done,

You ﬂoat like happiness
To the sun,
Untethered afternoon,

Unkind,
Marooning all
You’ve left behind:

Their tinfoil tears,
Their plastic cries,
Their wheedling

And moot goodbyes,
You shrug them off—
You do not heed—

O loose bloom
             With no root
                              No seed.
