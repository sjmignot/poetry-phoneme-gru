# The Dream of Reason
## Jenny George
I  Self-Portrait

A house
with three stories.
In the basement, monsters.
The upper floors were empty.
No furniture, nothing.
I had a magic pebble
that I needed to hide.
But where?
Woke in a room
with the bed breathing.
Each day the same
scandal—this body.
These teeth and hands.





2  The Miniature Bed

A miniature bed, and in it two tiny people
not sleeping, not able to sleep because
a small lie has flowered between them,
fragile as a new, white crocus.
The miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat
making its slow, true course to morning.
These tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice,
are quiet as the lie blooms over them
in the night, fanning its moth petals,
becoming to them like a moon hovering
over their bed, a moon they might almost touch
with their miniature hands, if they weren't certain
that one wrong gesture might break
the spindles of their small world, if their hearts
were not drops of trembling quicksilver,
if they were brave, if they could see
that small is no smaller than big, that thimbles
are deep as oceans for any god, they might even
touch each other then, opening the dark,
like a match, the sun's flaring.





3  Harvest

The fields are a book of uses.
Near the house
a combine takes the corn down
in long rows.
Dust rises up and replaces itself.
A quick net of starlings
drops to the furrows
and sunshine pours like polished grain
onto the feeding earth,
this country.

In the kitchen, milk streams
from the gallon
thin and fresh as luck.
We flourish.
All around us, things flourish.
Cows strain the fence with their abundance.
The herd makes a sound like swelling.

Out in the cut field
birds clean the fallen cobs
into sets of teeth.





4  Sonnet for Lost Teeth

The combines were tearing off the field’s clothes.
It was August, haying season. My tooth
was loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth.
I worked it like a pearl. I'd been out of school
for sixty days. In the sweat of the barn
I watched him shoot the calf in the head.
He wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses.
Overnight, I grew a beard so I wouldn't
have to get married. I let my feet go black
from burned grasses. _It never gets easier_
he said, kicking straw over the blood patch.
She went down so quiet it was almost
sad. Later, when my tooth fell out, I buried it
under my pillow and it grew into money.





5  Talisman

Waiting for the school bus you find
the femur of a baby animal
on the ground. You carry
that femur in your pocket
the entire morning and touch it
secretly through the cloth.
When the teacher asks
a question you don't raise
your hand but quietly
wrap your fingers around
the thin shape, that bone
without a mother.





6  On Waking

Half of everything is invisible.
A river drifts below the river.
A gesture lost in the body.
Wind moves through the open
windows of the trees.

Beyond the day, another day.

Dreamed I was drowning
my mother's silk laundry
in the river,
kneeling on the wet rocks.
Back and forth I drowned it
in the gray clouds...





7  Eros

Each year fish run the green vein of the river.
The bones of skunks lie buried in the riverbank
upside down, waiting for rain.

From a fragment of a Greek statue
you can tell the posture of the whole god.
A skeleton has the same intelligence.

So that when a girl discovers it,
loosened by summer rain, surfaced
like a white instrument in the grass,
she suddenly knows how to take it up
and shake the strange rhythms from it like castanets.





8  A Childhood

The horse had been beaten and flies
crawled excited on the beat marks.
He held still in the sunblazed pasture.
For a few minutes I stood at the wire fence.
He was aware of me, but he did not turn—
except his eye, slightly. He listened
through the many ears of the grasses.
A jay made a hole in the air with its cry.
Everywhere, invisible as heat, the gods
married each other and went to war.
The excitement of it vibrated in the flies.
As if we both were standing still
inside some greater, more violent motion.
