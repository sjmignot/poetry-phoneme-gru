# Crow's-eye view: Poem number eleven
## Yi Sang
the porcelain cup is similar to my skull. when i grasp the cup firmly with my
hand an arm out of nowhere sprouts on my arm like a graft and the hand on that
arm raises the porcelain cup high and hurls it to the wooden floor. since that
arm is safeguarding the porcelain cup the thing that is broken into pieces
then is my skull that is similar to the porcelain cup. even if my arm had
moved before the graft-arm slid into my arm like a snake the white paper that
warded off flood would have ripped. yet my arm continues to safeguard the
porcelain cup.
