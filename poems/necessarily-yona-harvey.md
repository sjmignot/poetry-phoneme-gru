# Necessarily
## Yona Harvey
_She’s got a hundred & two temperature_, delivery room nurses said. You’re
gonna live, though — long enough to know you’re going
to go as quickly as you came, gonna make your mother swear by you, going to
shake your Bible with red-tipped nails before you vanish
into Chicago South Side skies that bleed — not like watercolor, not like a
wound, not
like a fat, bitten plum — not necessarily. No, not necessarily.
Nothing that precious or predictable. _Speak nicely to others & they will
nicely_
 _speak to you_ , your mother said. No, not so, you said fairly
close to the end. No time to wait for mother’s ride home or for saviors,
coming soon.
