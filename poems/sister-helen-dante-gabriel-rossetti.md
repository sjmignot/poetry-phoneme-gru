# Sister Helen
## Dante Gabriel Rossetti
"Why did you melt your waxen man
Sister Helen?
To-day is the third since you began."
"The time was long, yet the time ran,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Three days to-day, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"But if you have done your work aright,
Sister Helen,
You'll let me play, for you said I might."
"Be very still in your play to-night,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Third night, to-night, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"You said it must melt ere vesper-bell,
Sister Helen;
If now it be molten, all is well."
"Even so,—nay, peace! you cannot tell,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_O what is this, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"Oh the waxen knave was plump to-day,
Sister Helen;
How like dead folk he has dropp'd away!"
"Nay now, of the dead what can you say,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_What of the dead, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"See, see, the sunken pile of wood,
Sister Helen,
Shines through the thinn'd wax red as blood!"
"Nay now, when look'd you yet on blood,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_How pale she is, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Now close your eyes, for they're sick and sore,
Sister Helen,
And I'll play without the gallery door."
"Aye, let me rest,—I'll lie on the floor,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_What rest to-night, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"Here high up in the balcony,
Sister Helen,
The moon flies face to face with me."
"Aye, look and say whatever you see,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_What sight to-night, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"Outside it's merry in the wind's wake,
Sister Helen;
In the shaken trees the chill stars shake."
"Hush, heard you a horse-tread as you spake,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_What sound to-night, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"I hear a horse-tread, and I see,
Sister Helen,
Three horsemen that ride terribly."
"Little brother, whence come the three,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Whence should they come, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"They come by the hill-verge from Boyne Bar,
Sister Helen,
And one draws nigh, but two are afar."
"Look, look, do you know them who they are,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Who should they be, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"Oh, it's Keith of Eastholm rides so fast,
Sister Helen,
For I know the white mane on the blast."
"The hour has come, has come at last,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Her hour at last, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"He has made a sign and called Halloo!
Sister Helen,
And he says that he would speak with you."
"Oh tell him I fear the frozen dew,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Why laughs she thus, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"The wind is loud, but I hear him cry,
Sister Helen,
That Keith of Ewern's like to die."
"And he and thou, and thou and I,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_And they and we, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Three days ago, on his marriage-morn,
Sister Helen,
He sicken'd, and lies since then forlorn."
"For bridegroom's side is the bride a thorn,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Cold bridal cheer, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Three days and nights he has lain abed,
Sister Helen,
And he prays in torment to be dead."
"The thing may chance, if he have pray'd,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_If he have pray'd, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"But he has not ceas'd to cry to-day,
Sister Helen,
That you should take your curse away."
" _My_ prayer was heard,—he need but pray,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Shall God not hear, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"But he says, till you take back your ban,
Sister Helen,
His soul would pass, yet never can."
"Nay then, shall I slay a living man,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_A living soul, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"But he calls for ever on your name,
Sister Helen,
And says that he melts before a flame."
"My heart for his pleasure far'd the same,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Fire at the heart, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Here's Keith of Westholm riding fast,
Sister Helen,
For I know the white plume on the blast."
"The hour, the sweet hour I forecast,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Is the hour sweet, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"He stops to speak, and he stills his horse,
Sister Helen;
But his words are drown'd in the wind's course."
"Nay hear, nay hear, you must hear perforce,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_What word now heard, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"Oh he says that Keith of Ewern's cry,
Sister Helen,
Is ever to see you ere he die."
"In all that his soul sees, there am I
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_The soul's one sight, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"He sends a ring and a broken coin,
Sister Helen,
And bids you mind the banks of Boyne."
"What else he broke will he ever join,
Little brother?"
_(O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_No, never join'd, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"He yields you these and craves full fain,
Sister Helen,
You pardon him in his mortal pain."
"What else he took will he give again,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Not twice to give, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"He calls your name in an agony,
Sister Helen,
That even dead Love must weep to see."
"Hate, born of Love, is blind as he,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Love turn'd to hate, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Oh it's Keith of Keith now that rides fast,
Sister Helen,
For I know the white hair on the blast."
"The short short hour will soon be past,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Will soon be past, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"He looks at me and he tries to speak,
Sister Helen,
But oh! his voice is sad and weak!"
"What here should the mighty Baron seek,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Is this the end, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"Oh his son still cries, if you forgive,
Sister Helen,
The body dies but the soul shall live."
"Fire shall forgive me as I forgive,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_As she forgives, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Oh he prays you, as his heart would rive,
Sister Helen,
To save his dear son's soul alive."
"Fire cannot slay it, it shall thrive,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Alas, alas, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"He cries to you, kneeling in the road,
Sister Helen,
To go with him for the love of God!"
"The way is long to his son's abode,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_The way is long, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"A lady's here, by a dark steed brought,
Sister Helen,
So darkly clad, I saw her not."
"See her now or never see aught,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_What more to see, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"Her hood falls back, and the moon shines fair,
Sister Helen,
On the Lady of Ewern's golden hair."
"Blest hour of my power and her despair,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Hour blest and bann'd, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Pale, pale her cheeks, that in pride did glow,
Sister Helen,
'Neath the bridal-wreath three days ago."
"One morn for pride and three days for woe,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Three days, three nights, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Her clasp'd hands stretch from her bending head,
Sister Helen;
With the loud wind's wail her sobs are wed."
"What wedding-strains hath her bridal-bed,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_What strain but death's, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"She may not speak, she sinks in a swoon,
Sister Helen,—
She lifts her lips and gasps on the moon."
"Oh! might I but hear her soul's blithe tune,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Her woe's dumb cry, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"They've caught her to Westholm's saddle-bow,
Sister Helen,
And her moonlit hair gleams white in its flow."
"Let it turn whiter than winter snow,
Little brother!"
_(O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Woe-wither'd gold, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"O Sister Helen, you heard the bell,
Sister Helen!
More loud than the vesper-chime it fell."
"No vesper-chime, but a dying knell,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_His dying knell, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Alas! but I fear the heavy sound,
Sister Helen;
Is it in the sky or in the ground?"
"Say, have they turn'd their horses round,
Little brother?"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_What would she more, between Hell and Heaven?)_

"They have rais'd the old man from his knee,
Sister Helen,
And they ride in silence hastily."
"More fast the naked soul doth flee,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_The naked soul, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Flank to flank are the three steeds gone,
Sister Helen,
But the lady's dark steed goes alone."
"And lonely her bridegroom's soul hath flown,
Little brother."
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_The lonely ghost, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Oh the wind is sad in the iron chill,
Sister Helen,
And weary sad they look by the hill."
"But he and I are sadder still,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Most sad of all, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"See, see, the wax has dropp'd from its place,
Sister Helen,
And the flames are winning up apace!"
"Yet here they burn but for a space,
Little brother! "
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Here for a space, between Hell and Heaven!)_

"Ah! what white thing at the door has cross'd,
Sister Helen?
Ah! what is this that sighs in the frost?"
"A soul that's lost as mine is lost,
Little brother!"
( _O Mother, Mary Mother,_
_Lost, lost, all lost, between Hell and Heaven!)_
