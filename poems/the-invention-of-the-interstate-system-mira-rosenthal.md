# The Invention of the Interstate System
## Mira Rosenthal
begins in dirt, clumps of Queen Anne’s lace, bindweed unfurling its moons in
the morning

 _to start somewhere to perform one’s certain act of  failure_

begins as still life with foliage and road

one man with a shovel, digging one measure-full of map, a clump resting heavy
on his blade

one woman in a house up the grade laboring at a washbasin, her hands pinked
raw, her mind worrying some idea east to west, passing it through every state
her imagination has to offer

begins with her view: blot of man in grass landscape

 _to throw one’s sorrow throw one’s lonely sorrow like a clod of dirt to the
sky_

begins with the sound of rustling, dried stalk against stalk in wind whipped
up by the motion metal makes through place

and you, love, in the passenger seat with muddy boots and what’s native to
your veins

the window rolled down, the hand making waves

and me admitting: I am that woman, I am that woman

 _make us thread and lace us let us be a vessel holding everything together_

silence to silence, thwap upon thwap of fence posts gauging speed

then _Briza maxima_ , big quaking grass rattling

a car towing a car with a hitch-line

the shock of scotch broom in a ditch giving order, yellowing the scene,
defining margin and median

the blocks of who lives where, the borders of recognizable plots we create
when we wake, we create in our wake

networked, but not in the way General Pershing displayed his blueprint  for
defense

 _to weave our fingers strong as rope to bond with knots something other  than
a nation_

begins with the defenseless, the redlined neighborhood thought less than

the dips and curves and blinker’s blitzing through the dark

we feel in the heart, centrifugal force

and we ride: no destination, no end to the turning ego, its fuel of
insecurities

 _to be moving and acting and weaving through space_

the trace of our being here, tattooed in asphalt like the body’s Blaschko
lines made visible

a pattern, a pattern manifest, the way we were made

 _your palm look at your palm look at all the connections you hold in your
hand_
