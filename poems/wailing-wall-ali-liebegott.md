# Wailing Wall
## Ali Liebegott
yesterday I was at the Wailing Wall
pretending to be a man, pretending to be a Jew

it was research for my job
still I tried to feel God, touched the Wall
said a prayer for my sick mother

the women go to one side
the men to the other

the rest of us float and bobble like space trash

around the corner is the empty co-ed wall
no one prays before the genderless stones
they smell the concession

the gay rabbi said Jerusalem
has been conquered forty-four times

I walk with the men, stolen yarmulke in my hand
past the dancing bar mitzvah boys
on the other side of the fence
their mothers throw hard candies at them
