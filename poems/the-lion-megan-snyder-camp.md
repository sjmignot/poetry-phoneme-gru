# The Lion
## Megan Snyder-Camp
Since kindergarten
my son's class has practiced
for when a lion

enters the building.
They have a safe wall
they crouch against.

A closet some of the children
fit into.
The lion roams

wild in the hall.
Races up the stairs.
When the lion

is at the door
they are taught
to think of emptiness.

Darkness.
A real lion not
some yellow-furred animal.
