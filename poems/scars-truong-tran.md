# scars
## Truong Tran
my father’s body is a map
a record of his journey

he carries a bullet
lodged in his left thigh
there is a hollow where it entered
a protruding bump where it sleeps
the doctors say it will never awaken

it is the one souvenir he insists on keeping
mother has her own opinions
 _bố_ _cùa con điên_ — _your father is crazy_

as a child
i wanted a scar just like my father’s
bold and appalling     a mushroom explosion
that said i too was at war
instead i settled for a grain of rice
a scar so small look closely there
here between the eyes
a bit to the right
there on the bridge of my nose

father says i was too young to remember
it happened while i was sleeping
leaking roof the pounding rain
drop after drop after drop
