# Nightmare Begins Responsibility
## Michael S. Harper
I place these numbed wrists to the pane
watching white uniforms whisk over
him in the tube-kept
prison
fear what they will do in experiment
watch my gloved stickshifting gasolined hands
breathe _boxcar-information-please_ infirmary tubes
distrusting white-pink mending paperthin
silkened end hairs, distrusting tubes
shrunk in his _trunk-skincapped_
shaven head, in thighs
 _distrusting-white-hands-picking-baboon-light_
on his son who will not make his second night
of this wardstrewn intensive airpocket
where his father's asthmatic
hymns of _night-train_ , train done gone
his mother can only know that he has flown
up into essential calm unseen corridor
going boxscarred home, _mamaborn, sweetsonchild_
 _gonedowntown_ into _researchtestingwarehousebatteryacid_
 _mama-son-done-gone_ /me telling her 'nother
train tonight, no music, no breathstroked
heartbeat in my infinite distrust of them:

and of my distrusting self
 _white-doctor-who-breathed-for-him-all-night_
say it for two sons gone,
say nightmare, say it loud
panebreaking heartmadness:
nightmare begins responsibility.
