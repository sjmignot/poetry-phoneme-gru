# Notes on My Present: A Contrapuntal
## Natalie Scenters-Zapico
With statements by President Donald Trump
I write my body, as border between
 _We have some bad hombres here_
this rock  & the absence of water.
 _& we’re going to get them out._
I cut myself with a scimitar,
 _When Mexico sends its people,_
as political documentation.
 _they’re not sending their best._
How do you write about the violence
 _They’re not sending you._
of every man you’ve ever loved?
 _They’re sending people_
Macho, you
 _that have lots of problems_
breathe bright in the neocolony,
 _& they’re bringing those problems to us_
a problem of Empire pulling
 _They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing_
the capitalist threads of my border.
 _crime. They’re rapists._
Empire: you were so sterile
 _Mexico’s court system [_ _is_ ]corrupt.
& shiny with your dead man’s coins
 _I want nothing to do with Mexico_
& castration, your white roses
 _other than to build an impenetrable_
& that trash bag full of a Mexican
 _WALL & stop them from ripping_
woman’s dark hair. Empire: you
 _off U.S. I love the Mexican people,_
made us hungry for the glint
 _but Mexico is not our friend._
of machismo, the dim glare
 _They’re killing us at the border_
of marianismo. Tonight on TV,
 _& they’re killing us on jobs  & trade._
muted montages of the largest
 _FIGHT! Happy #CincodeMayo!_
ICE raid in Texas. I drink
 _The best taco bowls are made_
pink champagne in a hotel bar,
 _in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!_
& correct the pronunciation of   my name.
