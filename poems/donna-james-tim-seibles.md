# Donna James
## Tim Seibles
I remember that first time:
the empty auditorium, her voice,
the dark all around us,
her mouth reaching into mine.
She was Freddy’s foxy older sister,
and I didn’t know why
she wanted to kiss me. She
had already finished high school
and probably shouldn’t have
been walking the halls, but
she always called me her _friend._
So one Monday after gym,

I found myself beside myself
in front of her house—with my
trench coat and lunch bag—
probably _not_ looking much
like Shaft. Inside, the air held
warm milk and we talked a bit
about her baby    and her Aunt
who paid the rent painting cars.

Maybe she liked me because
we were both black and mostly
alone in the suburbs, but I hadn’t
thought about that. It was her voice
that got me—banked fire, the color
of dusk—her voice, and my name
was smoke in her mouth.

I think about it more than I should now,
that January noon—an hour before
algebra—how most days I’d be
thinking football    or replaying
the seventy-some kisses I’d gotten
over those lean years, but that day

Donna and me were on the couch
munching potato chips. _Rrruffles_
 _have rrridges,_ she kidded coming
from checking the baby who’d
slipped into a nap. I was kind of
disappointed that we hadn’t
done anything, but I needed time
to get back to school, so I started
to stand. She said _wait,_
 _look at this mess,_

and with her left hand, she
brushed the crumbs from my lap
the way you’d whisk away lint—
then, swept over my pants again—
to be thorough, I guessed, but slower
and then some more, as if her hand

were getting    drowsy. You know
how sometimes you see something
but just can’t believe it—like a squirrel
bobbling a biscuit on your kitchen counter
or a cricket creeping the red feathers
of your mother’s Sunday hat?

Her hand _there,_ on my lap,
could easily have been a five-fingered
flying saucer from the fifth dimension.
For awhile, I just watched and
wondered if she knew where
her hand had landed    but it was me
who didn’t know: me with my
six dozen kisses and the great Eden
of my virginity. How
do we not talk about it

every day: the ways
we were changed
by the gift
in someone’s touch—your body,
suddenly a bright instrument
played by an otherwise
silent divinity.

When I heard my zipper, I couldn’t
have said where my arms
were    or what a clock was for:
I had
no idea    I could be such a stranger
and still be myself. How could I
have known what a girl

might do to a boy
with her mouth     if she felt
like doing what her mouth
could do? It was
a kind of miracle: the dreamed
 _impossible_ —my soul finally called
to my flesh. I didn’t know
what I didn’t know    and then I knew.
