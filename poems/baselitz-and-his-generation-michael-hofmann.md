# Baselitz and His Generation
## Michael Hofmann
For Hai-Dang Phan

I have no doubt where they will go. They walk
the one life offered from the many chosen.
 -- Robert Lowell

They are all also, it should be remembered, West German artists, with the
partial exception of Penck, and are all male.
 -- John-Paul Stonard

He was born in the countryside / the provinces / the blameless sticks
         in (  _false_ ) Waltersdorf ( _recte_ ) Dresden
         in what is now Czechoslovakia / the Czech Republic ( _laughs_ ) /
Czechia, if it
 ever catches on

         what’s it to you.

Stripped of his East German citizenship, he fled
         on foot with a handful of pop music cassettes
         in a pantechnicon _mit Kind und Kegel
_
         in pandemonium
          _nach vorne_
         cool as you like, in an S-Bahn from the Russian Sector, in the
clothes he
 stood up in.



Germany (thus Goethe’s friend Mme de Staël) is the land of poets and thinkers
 _der Dichter und Denker
_
         or of judges and executioners
          _der Richter und Henker_
         or of Richter and Penck.

He drew innocent geometrical shapes
         boxed shirts / boxer shorts / boxy suits
         men without women
         hairy heroes of the Thirty Years’ War / lansquenets / strangely
fibrous figures
 a bit like those _New Yorker_ caveman cartoons

         empty Renaissance helmets / mostly US fighter jets
         the suicides of Stammheim.

He took the name of an American boxing promoter
         a German Ice Age geologist
         the village of his birth
         the one he was given.

His first work to really catch on / be banned / get him in trouble / cause
widespread
revulsion was _Onkel Rudi_

          _Die große Nacht im Eimer
_
          _Höhere Wesen befahlen: rechte obere Ecke schwarz malen!_ / _oyez,_
_oyez, oyez_ ,
Politburo decree: upper right-hand corner in ebony!

          _ohne Titel_
         a mural in the cafeteria of the Hygiene Museum, since painted over.

He wound up in Düsseldorf
         Berlin, _doh_!
          _la bella Italia_
         tax-exempt Ireland of Böll- and Beuys-ful memory, where the  earth
apples bloom.

His paintings were fuzzy geometry
         like the country, ripped across the middle
         upside down (especially effective: the trees)
         shoveled out of the window
         later withdrawn.

His favored technique involved stick figures
         Polke dots
         out of focus grisaille photographs
         scribbling on his pictures
         woodcuts à la Dürer.

The numerals on his graphics represent a recent shopping bill
         an attempt to disconcert the onlooker / _ostranenie_
         amortization
         bar code
         some other code
          _Durchnummerierung._

He studied with Joseph Beuys
         the least doctrinaire painter he could find
         for the best part of ten years, in East and West, so that everything
canceled
 itself out

         what’s it to you
         he didn’t.
