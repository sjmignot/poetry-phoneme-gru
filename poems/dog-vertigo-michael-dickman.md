# Dog Vertigo
## Michael Dickman
Some teeth down there
some hair and gray
gums

Some grass and dirt
down there some gristle
and whimpers

All stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade

I had a dog
I had three dogs
I sit and stay

They did not disappear into
the trees one day

Their brains were not broken coral on the street

They were meat


•


Some leash
down there some shit
and tennis balls

I had a dog
I had three dogs
I sit and beg

Their brains were not broken coral on the street

They were not meat
one day they did not disappear
into the trees

All stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade

Some whimpers
down there some nipples
and pink tum-tums


•


Some biting tails
down there some sunlight
and long nails

Some fleas dug up some mange and gray tongues

I had a dog
They were meat
I had three dogs

They did not disappear into the streets
They did not tree

Some haunch skid
and drag down there some
mouths one day

They did not smell like baby’s breath

All stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade


•


Some grass and dirt
down there some teeth and
ruined carpets

I had a dog
I had three dogs
I fucked fleas

All stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade

Some eyelashes
down there some eating grass
and mange some
baby’s breath

One day their brains were not broken
coral on the street

They did not disappear into the trees


•

Some sit and stay
down there some meat
and sunlight

Their brains were not
broken coral on the street they
did not disappear into
the trees

They did not fuck fleas

All stupid grinning death running around the yard making a little child cry
         with each busted grass blade

Some bones and baby’s breath down there
some bark and seizures

Distant watery eyes

One day I had a dog

I had three dogs
