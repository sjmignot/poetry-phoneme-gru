# Nuances of a Theme by Williams
## Wallace Stevens
_It’s a strange courage_
 _you give me, ancient star:_

 _Shine alone in the sunrise_
 _toward which you lend no part!_

                          I
Shine alone, shine nakedly, shine like bronze,
that reflects neither my face nor any inner part
of my being, shine like fire, that mirrors nothing.

                         II
Lend no part to any humanity that suffuses
you in its own light.
Be not chimera of morning,
Half-man, half-star.
Be not an intelligence,
Like a widow’s bird
Or an old horse.
