We’d pout. Our mother, brisking off,
urged Darlings! — your vitamins & minerals
dissolve inside with the milk & this-&-that
into instructions rejiggering more
vitamins, minerals, milk & this-&-that
to fizz up & turn into actual you,
or me, or anybody & etc.

Experiment: — you might let drop
capsules & milk into spit in one
another’s cups. Watch, wait;
think, add, stir. I’ll be right back.

One day it quits.
The whole business quits. Imagine that.
