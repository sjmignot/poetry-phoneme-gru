# Warning:
## David Sullivan
A can of self-defense pepper spray says it may
 _irritate the eyes_ , while a bathroom heater says it’s
 _not to be used in bathrooms_. I collect warnings
the way I used to collect philosophy quotes.

Wittgenstein’s _There’s no such thing_
 _as clear milk_ rubs shoulders with a box
of rat poison which _has been found_
 _to cause cancer in laboratory mice_.
 __
Levinas’ _Language is a battering ram—_
 _a sign that says the very fact of saying,_
is as inscrutable as the laser pointer’s advice:
 _Do not look into laser with remaining eye_.

Last week I boxed up the solemn row
of philosophy tomes and carted them down
to the used bookstore. The dolly read:
 _Not to be used to transport humans._
 __
Did lawyers insist that the 13-inch wheel
on the wheelbarrow proclaim it’s
 _not intended for highway use_? Or that
 _Curling iron is for external use only?_

Abram says that realists _render material_
 _to give the reader the illusion of the ordinary._
What would he make of this injunction? _Shin pads_
 _cannot protect any part of the body they do not cover._
 __
I load boxes of books onto the counter. Flip
to a yellow-highlighted passage in Aristotle:
 _Whiteness which lasts for a long time is no whiter_
 _than whiteness which lasts only a day._
 __
A.A.ers talk about the blinding glare of the obvious:
 _Objects in the mirror are actually behind you._
 _Electric cattle prod only to be used on animals._
 _Warning: Knives are sharp._ Thank you!

What would I have done without: _remove infant_
 _before folding for storage, Do not use hair dryer_
 _while sleeping, Eating pet rocks may lead to broken teeth,_
 _Do not use deodorant intimately_?

Goodbye to all those books that sought to puncture
the illusory world—not unlike the warning on the
polyester Halloween outfit I bought for my son:
 _Superman costume will not enable you to fly._
