# She's a Pill

            Oh, dangling long sleeves in the Mercurochrome.
            Parking her punch on her knees.

     I’m not a joiner.

            In the night, a visitation, small as a thumb,
            enters the sealed house and ascends.

     Mother wouldn’t have stood for _that_ long. Drippy-drooping around
on heels. Leaving the blue cheese out.
