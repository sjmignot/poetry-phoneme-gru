# Dream: Bluejay or Archeopteryx
## Margaret Atwood
### 1969

Kneeling on rock
By lakeside, sun
In the sky and also in
The water, that other
Self of mine also 
Kneeling on rock

On the seared bushes the hard
Berries squeezed out from
Stem ends in spite of

The red needles crackling
On the ground, the sand, among
the roots, firedry

my four hands gathering
in either world, the berries
in the dish glowed blue
embers

		a bird
lit on both branches

his beak split / his tin
scream forked in the air

warning. above me
against the sun I saw
his lizard eye
		looked
down.     gone

in the water 
under my shadow
there was an outline, man
surfacing, his body sheathed
in feathers, his teeth
glinting like nails, fierce god
head crested with blue flame
