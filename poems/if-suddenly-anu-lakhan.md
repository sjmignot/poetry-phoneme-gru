# If suddenly
## Anu Lakhan
If suddenly she rears
pulls, pitches
into the lightning

if the split sky strikes
splinters the glassy ground
(her stride is a circle growing smaller)

when she sees the stars
â€”all skies have storms
and she has seen them

if she shies and starts
when she skids
when she lowers her eyes
if she stops to listen:

nervous rider, beware.
