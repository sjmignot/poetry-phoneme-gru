First you must lift the idea
(be careful it may be heavy)
and haul it out to the dumpster.
Next locate the meaningâ€"it may not
come easily, though if you have
the right tools and they are good tools
you should have no difficulty. Now
it is the sentences' turn: take each one
strip it of grammar (you may need
abrasives here) and hang them all
on a line. When thoroughly dried,
lay each one down on the grass or
if you live in the city, the sidewalk will do.
The point is, make sure you put them
in harm's way, wherever you are.
Don't try to protect them. It may be
they will go to war, or wander the desert
or haunt the streets like beggars
or run from the police or suffer
loneliness and despair. Remember:
they must make their own way. The best
you can do is to stay out of theirs
and take them back in if they return.
