# I Belong Here
## Ray Gonzalez
There is no act of forgiveness,
only the redeeming light on
the shoulders dancing in
tall weeds, cigarettes gone
and the girls slapping free.

The tortilla cart burns against
the wall because Jesus called
my brother who was acquired
by whistling gangs of men
under the hanging arch.

There can be no night without
the wind on shoulders exhausted
by games and messages my brother
lost between the darkness and
the bridge into Juarez, Mexico,

where no crows caw because
the buildings are torn and
flashlights are narrow in
their beaming stumble,
my thoughts the last ones
on this side of the river,

my sudden happiness hidden
in celestial light without being
appalled at what I see, my ears
to the ground listening to weeds
overrun by boys who can’t spell
and are waiting for me without
knowing pilgrims are on the border.

Whatever kills them spares me
the journey to beg for purity
among unspoken Spanish
everyone fears in their greed.
The group doesn’t know it is
what the river stones teach,
though I can’t speak of them

because faith is prehistoric and
my brother is pursued by dust
storms that erase his footprints
across the back roads where he
loses his language of need.
