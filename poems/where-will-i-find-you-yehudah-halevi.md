# Where Will I Find You
## Yehudah Halevi
Where, Lord, will I find you:
your place is high and obscured.
         And where
               won't I find you:
         your glory fills the world.
You dwell deep within—
 __ you’ve fixed the ends of creation.
You stand, a tower for the near,
 __ refuge to those far off.
You’ve lain above the Ark, here,
 __ yet live in the highest heavens.
 __ Exalted among your hosts,
 __ although beyond their hymns—
 __ no heavenly sphere
 __ could ever contain you,
 __ let alone a chamber within.

In being borne above them
 __ on an exalted throne,
you are closer to them
 __ than their breath and skin.
Their mouths bear witness for them,
 __ that you alone gave them form.
 __ Your kingdom’s burden is theirs;
 __ who wouldn’t fear you?
 __ And who could fail
 __ to search for you—
 __ who sends down food when it is due?

I sought your nearness.
 __ With all my heart I called you.
And in my going out to meet you,
 __ I found you coming toward me,
as in the wonders of your might
 __ and holy works I saw you.
 __ Who would say he hasn’t seen
 __ your glory as the heavens’
 __ hordes declare
 __ their awe of you
 __ without a sound being heard?

But could the Lord, in truth,
 __ dwell in men on earth?
How would men you made
 __ from the dust and clay
fathom your presence there,
 __ enthroned upon their praise?
 __ The creatures hovering over
 __ the world praise your wonders—
 __ your throne borne high
 __ above their heads,
 __ as you bear all forever.
