# Chorus Attempting to Interpret Unearthed Fragments of Their Play
## Carolina Ebeid
Can you let go the concern
for how it began      what happened

Here the word _house_ remains
A _reddening_ (      ) near _house_

To describe the sounds
coming in      A human voice
barks through the window

the same voice      like horsehair
stretched along the bow drawn
across the strings

Where the action is missing
we place (      ) A girl pours out

water from a pail flung up
so that the water      arches
into a sickle in an instant
of daylight

The word _swallows_       as a complaint
of swallows raiding the air
suddenly thick with gnats

When you notice the ash
you will mutter _ash_
& it will appear again: ash
on everything, behind the ears ash

Maybe this shadow belongs
to the house at 4:30
Shadow is a length of gauze
loosened over the garden

It began with blizzards
for nine hours

A _cleft_ on the ceiling
or a _cleft_ in the chest
No matter, a cleft let
the weather in

Here is a description
of a face in anger
a _weather of arrows_

Instead of counting sheep
the injured man folds clothes
in his head into heaps

Separate what is missing
from what’s disappeared

(here has been eaten by silverfish)
We are left to think of (      )

as the space between falling
asleep  & waking up
 _Swallow_ can be a passage

the gullet, throat,
a grave in the ground
We’re surrounded by swallows

that open (      ) so fluent with bodies
nobodies

Here there was a story
& we were part of the after-
waves in a disaster

braiding wreaths of roadside flowers

The violet ones we’ll call purple daughters
The white ones: asylum lights
