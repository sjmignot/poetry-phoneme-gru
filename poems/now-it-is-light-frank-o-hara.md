# Now it is Light...
## Frank O'Hara
### 1955

Now it is light, now it is the calm
Yellow after the night goes to sleep.

A goat picks its way down 14th Street
Through the briars of the candenza of dull things

Which the moon has summoned with
Its guitar-like gutters—Sit down, boy!

I say Waldo, sit down!—resting
His curly head on the curb the sailor

Finds his ship is dragging him slowly
Into the harbor, where the oil scum

Fills his tearless eyes with a
Nonchalant reflection, sunless, harmless.

Captain, it’s not day yet, but you
Are pulling out. And as the sun comes up

The yellow dies into a glaring white
Which is only the night’s reflection.
