# The Human Figure in a Dress
## Mary Jo Bang
Naked or not, I’m a costume that moves, figurine with a face that changes. You
could call me a mood. I begin cheerful but sometimes turn solemn when
confronted with my own mythology (wolf in a cape, cat scratch on a cupboard
door, mouse tail in the hand of a bland farmer’s wife, a drop of blood on her
shoe). Today’s beginning ended in a dream. In a fantastical bed, a lover
leaned in to kiss me just as I realized I was part machine, part primitive
urge. I left the bed and said, You know, don’t you, not everyone is so
disposed. And then I heard from inside my head, You should say, not everyone
is so disposed to your utopia. Only then did I realize I’d been inexact. Even
here there are scolds that tell you how to be. Sometimes they live inside.
Naked or not, I am trying to tuck my arms invisibly behind my back so that all
you can see are my breasts and my highly simplified head.
