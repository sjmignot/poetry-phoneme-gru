# Relationships
## Jill Magi
Family, lover, colleague. Notions, veneers, nation. Teeth of no health
insurance.

A boom can be a microphone affixed to a pole and not an explosion.

Shadows, we sweep at them constantly and on the table is chocolate,
newspapers, commentary, and vastly different pay stubs.




I lean in to you and wish to love you perfectly.

Suffer, tumble, strive, the right shoes, and vacation.

At the table, conference and always pretty, the fixed.

Shimmer of repulsion or fairy tale of cleavage.




I count pleasures like cream, sipping, speaking. I like fashion as well.


All the hymns you and I know as his headboard knocks against our wall, the
slap when he coughs, our neighbor.




The most racist of all positions at the staff meeting is to tell us about your
shocking talent if there is a most. A prayer dangles over this bitter.




Looping coves of sympathy. How to history.




My flat speech in variously adopted professional tones.

Merger of you and me and take whatever you want.

Her beautiful poetry face. His intellectual arms.

I worry about the ferocious place in you while framing it.




A person as diversion, a thing beautiful, a small green-blue egg in a spring
next and now the field is gendered.





Have you seen the moment of last light? It means something to me.





Assuming my gender qualifies your hearing and therefore my speech, you overlap
words with mine in what appears to be a neutral manner but your speech acts as
solvent.





Down the hall, high heels as metronome, watched.

Out of our bodies comes speech as clouds, flag, windsock, bandage.



Dear—
You could make more money if you wanted to. Such as a day of beauty,
persuasive levels of caring. For example: doing both brow and lip.



Are you spending or quiet?




Let’s go to lunch would mean exchanging speech and then carrying warm food in
plastic bags.




Coherence as my mother sleeps after a complicated surgery.

And if I were, would you be generous with me as well?





Race ran the organization which one.

We socialize in this real estate of gerrymandered potlucks.

I think there exists silence as a legitimate response and I will say that now.



The caring for our souls by old black women in the narrative of a college
president, passing. Excuse me for not knowing passing.

You remember but only after the spine is broken.




Something in chemistry called suspension equals your ghosts caught in my air.




The Bronx is horning was a line they wrote where I was educated, teaching.




Response to migration: the pullback of the form remains as a hum, a tongue.
