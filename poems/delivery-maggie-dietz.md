               1. Waking

First the low drone of
uilleann pipes, the river
of the spine just barely
quivering: the froth
on a half-drunk pint
of Guiness shifting
as the bellow breathes.


               2. Waiting

A pressure sprouting
in the back—the joke
I told about having
eaten a pumpkin seed
to astonish the moon-
faced toddler gawping
at my beach ball belly
in the grocery line.


                3. Pitocin

What the     hell is this
no one said     chaos I
can't find the     cerulean
beach, the sun-     rayed
trail through     rain-cooled
woods can't    find your
face the     soft flamenco
music     hurts I
hate     it you
turn     off
it     now


                4. Lidocaine

Flying bullets, bats,
then, finally, birds.
Swallows sky-diving
for mosquitos above
the quiet reservoir
at dusk. Iridescent
synchronicity, twisting
together as if on
strings. You must
listen hard to hear
the soft applause of
(closed in unison)
a thousand wings.


                5. Parturition

Hosannas in the skull
halls: I see as if from
above a body brought
to its knees, every one
of its live cells singing

 _Hosanna_ for "we praise
you" and "please save
us" as being trains its
way into the lighted
room, the ravaged world.
