# The Gulf, 1987
## Deborah Paredez
The day upturned, flooded with sunlight, not
a single cloud. I squint into the glare,
cautious even then of bright emptiness.
We sit under shade, Tía Lucia
showing me how white folks dine, _the high life_.
I am about to try my first oyster,
Tía spending her winnings from the slots
on a whole dozen, the glistening valves
wet and private as a cheek’s other side,
broken open before us. _Don’t be shy_.
 _Take it all in at once_. Flesh and sea grit,
sweet meat and brine, a taste I must _acquire_.
In every split shell, the coast’s silhouette:
bodies floating in what was once their home.
