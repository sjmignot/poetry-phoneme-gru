## Hayan Charara
_An_ assumption, _a_ pejorative, _an_ honest language,
 _an_ honorable death. In grade school, I refused to _accept_
the mayor’s handshake; he smiled at everyone _except_
people with names like mine. I was born here.
I didn’t have to _adopt_ America, but I _adapted_ to it.
You understand: a man must be _averse_ to opinions
that have _adverse_ impacts on whether he lives
or dies. “Before taking any _advice,_ know the language
of those who seek to _advise_ you.” Certain words
 _affected_ me. Sand nigger, I was called. Camel jockey.
What was the _effect_? While I _already_ muttered
under my breath, I did so even more. I am not
 _altogether_ sure we can _all together_ come. Everything
was not _all right._ Everything is not _all right._
Imagine poetry without _allusions_ to Shakespeare,
Greek mythology, the Bible; or _allusions_ without
the adjectives “fanatical,” “extremist,” “Islamic,”
“right,” “left,” “Christian,” “conservative,” “liberal.”
Language written or translated into a single tongue
gives the _illusion_ of tradition. _A lot_ of people murder
language— _a lot_ fully aware. _Among_ all the dead,
choose _between_ “us” and “them.” _Among_ all the names
for the dead—mother, father, brother, sister,
husband, wife, child, friend, colleague, neighbor,
teacher, student, stranger—choose _between_
“citizen” and “terrorist.” And poet? _Immoral,_
yes, but never _amoral_? Large _amounts,_ the number
between 75 and 90 percent of the estimated
150 million to 1 billion—civilians—killed during wars,
over all of recorded human history. _Anxious_ is “worried”
or “apprehensive.” American poetry, Americans.
Young, I learned _anyone_ born here could become
President. Older, I can point to _any one_ of a hundred
reasons why this is a lie. _Anyway_ , I don’t want to be
President, not of a country, or club, not here or there,
not _anywhere._ He said, “I turned the car around _because_
it began raining bombs.” There’s no chance of ambiguity—
an _as_ here could mean “because” or “when”; it makes
no difference—he saw the sky, felt the ground,
knew what would come next; it matters little
when the heart rate in less than a second jumps from
70 to 200 beats per minute. What they did
to my grandfather was _awful_ —its wretchedness,
awe-inspiring; its cruelty, terrible; it was _awfully_
hard to forget. Just after 8:46 AM, I wondered _awhile_
what would happen next. At 9:03 AM, I knew
there was going to be trouble for a _while_ to come.
When in her grief the woman said, “We’re going
to hurt them _bad_ ,” she meant to say, “We’re going
to hurt them _badly._ ” For seventeen days, during
air strikes, my grandfather slept on a cot _beside_
a kerosene lamp in the basement of his house. _Besides_
a few days worth of pills, and a gallon of water,
he had nothing else to eat or drink. Given these conditions,
none of us were surprised that on the eighteenth day,
he died. _Besides,_ he was eighty-two years old.
I can write what I please. I don’t need to ask, _May_ I?
Like a song: men with _capital_ meet in the _Capitol_
in the nation’s _capital._ Any disagreements, _censored_ ;
those making them—poets, dissenters, activists—
 _censured._ The aftermath, approximately 655,000
people killed. “The Human Cost of War in Iraq:
A Mortality Study, 2002-2006,” Bloomsburg School
of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore,
Maryland); School of Medicine, Al Mustansiriya University
(Baghdad, Iraq); in cooperation with the Center
for International Studies, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts).
The figure just _cited_ —655,000 dead—resulted from
a household survey conducted at actual _sites,_ in Iraq,
not the Pentagon, or White House, or a newsroom,
or someone’s imagination. Of _course,_ language has been
corrupted. Look, the President, who speaks _coarsely,_
says, “We must stay the _course._ ” The problem with
“Let your _conscience_ be your guide” is you must first
be aware, _conscious_ , of the fact that a moral principle
is a subjective thing. I wonder: when one “smokes ’em
out of a hole,” if the person doing the smoking
is _conscious_ of his _conscience_ at work. Am I fully _conscious_
of how I arrived at this? The _continual_ dissemination
of similar images and ideas. The _continual_ aired footage
of planes striking the towers, the towers crumbling
to the streets, dust, screams, a _continuous_ reel of destruction,
fear, as if the attacks were happening twenty-four hours
a day, every day, any time. For a while, I _couldn’t care less_
about war. Then I saw corpses, of boys, who looked
just like me. This was 1982, at age ten. Ever since,
I _couldn’t care less_ why anyone would want it.
In 1982, any one of those boys _could have_ been me.
Now, it’s any one of those dead men could be me.
The Secretary of State offered such _counsel_
to the ambassadors of the world that the United Nations
Security _Council_ nodded in favor of war. _Criterion_
easily becomes _criteria._ Even easier: to no longer
require either. The _data_ turned out false. The doctrine
of preemption ultimately negated its need. While we
both speak English, our languages are so _different from_
each other, yours might as well be Greek to me.
When the black man in the park asked, “Are you
Mexican, Puerto Rican, or are you Pakistani?”
and I said, “I’m Arab,” and he replied, “Damn.
Someone _don’t_ like you very much,” I understood
perfectly what he meant. The President alluded
to the Crusades because of (not _due to_ ) a lack
of knowledge. Later, he retracted the statement,
worried it might offend the Middle East;
it never occurred to him the offense taken was _due to_
the bombs shredding them to bits and pieces. “You are
 _either_ with us or with the terrorists” (September 20, 2001).
“You’re _either_ with us or against us” (November 6, 2001).
The day after, the disc jockey advocated, on air,
a thirty-three cent solution (the cost of a bullet)
to the problem of terrorists in our midst—he meant
in New York; also, by terrorists, I wonder did he know
he meant cab drivers, hot dog vendors, students, bankers,
neighbors, passersby, New Yorkers, Americans;
did he know he also meant Sikhs, Hindus, Iranians,
Africans, Asians; did he know, too, he meant Christians,
Jews, Buddhists, Atheists; did he realize he was _eliciting_
a violent response, on the radio, in the afternoon?
Among those who did not find the remark at all _illicit:_
the owners of the radio station, the FCC, the mayor,
the governor, members of the House, the Senate,
the President of the United States. _Emigrate_ is better
than _immigrate._ Proof: no such thing as illegal _emigration._
Further proof: emigration is never an election issue.
I heard _enthusiastic_ speeches. They hate our freedoms,
our way of life, our this, that, and the other, _and so on_
(not etc). Not _everyone_ agreed _every one_ not “with us”
was “against us.” Detroit was _farther_ from home
than my father ever imagined. He convinced himself
soon after arriving here he had ventured _further_
than he should have. _Fewer_ people live in his hometown
than when he left, in 1966. The number, even _less,_
following thirty-four straight days of aerial bombardment.
 _First_ (not _firstly)_ my father spoke Arabic; _second_
(not _secondly)_ he spoke broken English; _third_ (not _thirdly)_
he spoke Arabic at home and English at work;
 _fourth_ (not _fourthly)_ he refused to speak English
anymore. Not every poem is _good._ Not every poem
does well. Not every poem is _well,_ either. Nor does
every poem do _good._ “To grow the economy”
is more than jargon. Can a democracy _grow_
without violence? Ours didn’t. They still plan to _grow_
tomatoes this year, despite what was done.
Several men, civilian workers, identified as enemies,
were _hanged_ on a bridge, bodies torched, corpses
swaying in the breeze. Photographs of the dead
were _hung_ with care. I can _hardly_ describe what is
going on. Day after day, he told _himself,_ “I am
an American. I eat apple pie. I watch baseball.
I speak American English. I read American poetry.
I was born in Detroit, a city as American as it gets.
I vote. I work. I pay taxes, too many taxes. I own a car.
I make mortgage payments. I am not hungry. I worry
less than the rest of the world. I could stand to lose
a few pounds. I eat several types of cuisine
on a regular basis. I flush toilets. I let the faucet drip.
I have central air conditioning. I will never starve
to death or experience famine. I will never die
of malaria. I can say whatever the fuck I please.”
Even words succumbed; _hopefully_ turned into
a kind of joke; _hopeful,_ a slur. _However,_ I use the words,
but less, with more care. The President _implied_
compassion; but _inferred_ otherwise. This is not
meant to be _ingenious._ Nor is it _ingenuous._
The more he got _into_ it, the more he saw poetry,
like language, was _in_ a constant state of becoming.
 _Regardless,_ or because of this, he welcomed the misuse
of language. Language is _its_ own worst enemy—
 _it’s_ the snake devouring _its_ own tail. They thought
of us not _kind of_ or _sort of_ but as _somewhat_ American.
 _Lie_ : “To recline or rest on a surface?” No. “To put
or place something?” No. Depleted uranium, heavy
like _lead_ ; its use—uranium shells— _led_ to birth defects.
When in his anger the man said, “We’re going
to _teach_ them a lesson,” I wonder what he thought
they would _learn._ In a war, a soldier is _less likely_
to die than a civilian. He looks _like_ he hates our freedoms.
You don’t know them _like_ I do. He looks _as_ if he hates
our freedoms. You don’t know them _as_ I do.
When in his sorrow my father said, “Everybody
 _loose_ in war,” I knew exactly what he meant. It _may be_
poets should fight wars. _Maybe_ then, metaphors—
not bodies, not hillsides, not hospitals, not schools—
will explode. I _might have_ watched the popular sitcom
if not for my family—they were under attack,
they _might have_ died. Others _may have_ been laughing
at jokes while bodies were being torn apart.
I could not risk that kind of laughter. Of all the _media_
covering war, which _medium_ best abolishes the truth?
I deceive _myself._ I will deceive you _myself._ In the Bronx,
I _passed_ as Puerto Rican. I _passed_ as Greek in Queens,
also Brazilian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, even a famous,
good-looking American movie actor. As Iranian
in Manhattan. At the mall in New Jersey,
the sales clerk guessed Italian. Where Henry Ford
was born, my hometown, I always _pass_ as Arab.
I may look like the men in the great paintings
of the Near East but their lives, their ways, I assure you,
are in the _past. Plus,_ except in those paintings,
or at the movies, I never saw Arabs with multiple wives,
or who rode camels, lived in silk tents, drank from
desert wells; _moreover,_ it’s time to move _past_ that.
Did language _precede_ violence? Can violence _proceed_
without language? It broke my father’s heart
to talk about the _principle_ of equal justice.
The news aired several _quotations_ from the airline
passengers, one of whom was a middle-aged man
with children, who said, “I didn’t feel safe with them
on board.” He used the word “them” though only one,
an Arab, was on the plane. Being from Detroit,
I couldn’t help but think of Rosa Parks.
Then I got angry. I said to the TV, to no one
in particular, “If you don’t feel safe, then you
get off the goddamn plane.” You can _quote_ me
on that. I was _really_ angry—not _real_ angry,
but _really_ angry. The _reason_? A poet asked me
why I didn’t write poems about Muslim and Arab
violence against others, and I said I did. And then
he said he meant violence against Americans and Israelis,
 _respectively,_ and I said I did, and before I could
go on he interrupted to ask why I didn’t write
poems about mothers who sent their sons and daughters
on suicide missions. As if, as if, as if. I _respectfully_
decline to answer any more questions. Write your own
goddamn poem! Does this poem gratify the physical senses?
Does it use _sensuous_ language? It certainly does not
attempt to gratify those senses associated with
sexual pleasure. In this way, it may not be a _sensual_ poem.
However, men have been known to experience
sexual gratification in situations involving power,
especially over women, other men, life, and language.
My father said, “No matter how angry they make you,
invite the agents in the house, offer them coffee,
be polite. If they stay long, ask them to _sit._ Otherwise,
they will try to _set_ you straight.” When in his
frustration he said, “ _Should of,_ could of, would of,”
he meant, “Stop, leave me alone, I refuse to examine
the problem further.” Because (not _since_ ) the terrorists
attacked us, we became more like the rest of the world
than ever before. This is _supposed_ to be a poem;
it is _supposed_ to be in a conversation with you.
Be _sure to_ participate. “No language is more violent
 _than_ another,” he said. _Then_ he laughed, and said,
“Except the one you use.” Do conflicts of interest
exist when governments award wartime contracts
to companies _that_ have close ties to government officials?
From 1995 to 2000, Dick Cheney, Vice President
of the United States, was CEO of Halliburton,
 _which_ is headquartered in Houston, Texas,
near Bush International Airport. Would they benefit
 _themselves_ by declaring war? Please send _those_ men
back home. My grandfather lay _there_ unconscious.
For days, _there_ was no water, no medicine, nothing
to eat. The soldiers left _their_ footprints at the doorstep.
His sons and daughters, _they’re_ now grieving him.
“Try not _to_ make _too_ much of it” was the advice given
after _two_ Homeland Security agents visited my house,
not once, not twice, but three times. I’m _waiting for_
my right mind. The language is a long _ways_ from here.
After the bombs fell, I called every night to find out
 _whether_ my father was alive or dead. He always asked,
“How’s the _weather_ there?” Soon enough, he assured me,
things would return to normal, _that_ (not _where_ )
a ceasefire was on the way. _Although_ (not _while_ )
I spoke English with my father, he replied in Arabic.
Then I wondered, _who’s_ to decide _whose_ language it is
anyway—you, me? _your_ mother, father, books,
perspective, sky, earth, ground, dirt, dearly departed,
customs, energy, sadness, fear, spirit, poetry, God,
dog, cat, sister, brother, daughter, family, _you,_ poems,
nights, thoughts, secrets, habits, lines, grievances,
breaks, memories, nightmares, mornings, faith, desire,
sex, funerals, metaphors, histories, names, tongues,
syntax, coffee, smoke, eyes, addiction, witness, paper,
fingers, skin, _you_ , _your_ , _you’re_ here, there, the sky,
the rain, the past, sleep, rest, live, stop, go, breathe
