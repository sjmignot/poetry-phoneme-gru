# Future Memories
## Mario Meléndez
My sister woke me very early
that morning and told me
“Get up, you have to come see this
the ocean’s filled with stars”
Delighted by the revelation
I dressed quickly and thought
 _If the ocean’s filled with stars
_
I must take the first flight
and collect all of the fish from the sky
