# Fault Whispers
## Mark Tardi
    “A skeleton’s mouth makes few concessions to prettiness.”
—Jacques Joubert


Because your mouth is violet and you cannot speak

Because maybe I like Thursdays the way I used to hate baths, and


baths are boundaries whose sharpness will be blurred with more information

Because movement itself is a form of currency


Frozen in articulations

Because don’t indulge yourself in the idea of restraint


The blackened patches could have been pubic hair on dead bodies, or simply
the wildness of neglect

without horizons or spaces


Because it’s a comfort to know waste is the fuel of contradictions

a knife rusted before its first use


Because in the barest of rooms, nothing is comprehensible

Neither fanatic nor mystic


Because the first weeks of September came and went and the weather held


Not woven by innocent hands

Because this stasis is preparation


Because you’re deceased, maimed or in Philadelphia
