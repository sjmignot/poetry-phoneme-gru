# Chicken Pig
## Jennifer Michael Hecht
It’s like being lost
in the forest, hungry, with a
plump live chicken in your cradling
arms: you want to savage the bird,
but you also want the eggs.

You go weak on your legs.
What’s worse, what you need
most is the companionship,
but you’re too hungry to know that.
That is something you only know after
you’ve been lost a lot and always,

eventually, alit upon
your bird; consumed her
before you’d realized what
a friend she’d been, letting you
sleep-in late on the forest floor
though she herself awoke
at the moment of dawn

and thought of long-lost
rooster voices quaking
the golden straw. She
looks over at you, sleeping,
and what can I tell you, she loves
you, but like a friend.

Eventually, when lost
in a forest with a friendly chicken
you make a point of emerging
from the woods together,
triumphant; her, fat with bugs,
you, lean with berries.

Still, while you yet wander,
you can not resist telling her
your joke:

Guy sees a pig with three legs,
asks the farmer, _What gives_?
Farmer says, _That pig woke_
_my family from a fire_ , _got us all out_.
Says the guy, _And lost the leg thereby_?
_Nope_ , says the farmer,
_Still had all four when he took_
_a bullet for me when I had_
_my little struggle with the law_.
Guy nods, _So that’s where_
_he lost his paw_? Farmer shakes
it off, says, _Nah_ , _we fixed him up_.
A pause, guy says, _So how’d he lose_
_the leg_? Farmer says, _Well_ , _hell_ ,
_a pig like that_
_you don’t eat all at once_.

Chicken squints. Doesn’t think
it’s funny.
