# Said the Parakeet
## Sandra McPherson
              B.D. was a decent
poet but difficult
to define or for himself to self-divine,
a follower, a “gift” the way one seeker,
loose but selective,
identified himself
to an intoxication
reading obnubilating poems
in a brick-and-river town:
a generous, ecstatic overnight.
A present, or an absence
needing to be present, who tailed me,
who mailed women years ago when he
was free with his attention,
a fixation that he felt attended _him_.

               Sometimes several times a week
then several times a day
he’d write me, for he was free
to borrow books, go to the mailbox
at 3 a.m., for it was urgent that he send
a bride issue of _Vogue_ , _Bazaar_ ,
(not _Seventeen_ , but _Glamour_ , but not _Ms_.)
from the Heartland where
( _Don’t forget our wedding date!_ )
he bubble wrapped some trinkets, snapshots —
poses of his parakeet beside his own long head

               meeting at an angle in a steely mirror.
His wife, from her wheelchair,
had made their camera flash.
 _He tried to kill his wife
_
with a little hammer,
the D.A. calling said. The D.A. asks
who are his friends; he cannot name
or call a single one. Define what
friendship saves your isolation from.
Detained, he clarifies for me:
 _It was a_ little _hammer._

           His cursive changed to printing
turns to scribbling
before during after in the medical facility.
He isn’t a bad poet. _A decent poet
_
and a bad carpenter, says Vonnegut
at dinner one free-and-easy evening in our town.
Some centuries go by
and on archival acid-free papyrus
or newfound stock of eco-friendly mulberry

               an American _Greek Anthology_ :
a poem by B.D.,
and next to him one by Anonymous
influenced by somebody who influenced
anxiety in all of us.
My fragment says, _She lived, who was his nail.
_
And she _lived, unguarded, curiously_
—  _by no one that she really knew_  —
 _held very dear._
