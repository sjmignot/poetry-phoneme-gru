# Guard? Guard!
## Ed Skoog
Tournaments lasted days and changed you,
but today the living and dead are speaking
through microphone of “I Voted” button,
erogenous zone, a place in the mind’s wrestle,
pause that votes and bets. Other voters return
to homes, run dishwasher, read to kids,
get high and craft. Still others walk the golf course
turning gold with sprinkler. Returns are noted.
No one hangs who had not already planned to hang.
At some point I’ve thrown almost everything,
and broken within, activated like a glow stick.
It is a sustained throwing; an act with its stink
of trash — power out — each evening, the stairs
and the light switch, and a pause at the open door.

Unenunciated stair-structures are closing off
the switch from voice to silence. This morning,
a snail bore its huge garden shell, the color of owl,
into the afternoon. How to choose what to bring!
I set the excess down by the door, for nobody
who is there, or seems that way. Near the fire.
Where the weather vane points is where I’ll carry
my father, slung fleece and steady footfall
into the valley of the painting above the couch,
brushstrokes crazed and smoked, enveloping the riders,
us, trot-dazed in a conjectured landscape
paralyzed by the wind’s chisel. The clouds are a sheet
the volcano staples above parking lots to hills
where owners shit and talk on the last phones.

As long as the sheet holds I will be darling.
Or it is the mildewed sail battened down
where I hide from fathers. Light rain makes
rooftops new. Boughs fracture like lines
an iced-over pond zags ahead of a boot
and in there we get glimpses of inquiry,
otherness to learn more about. Silence
becomes the subject the speaker set out to be,
landscape’s counterpart, and reflection
my resemblance. A hand goes up to stop
the process, and, when the process doesn’t stop,
suppresses until the next moment approaches,
and passes, the bid dizzy with regeneration.
Let’s fold this balloon into animals, vehicles, a weapon,

the air inside song, or last breath, or first. I’m a dog
when I ape my words. Who would dent or differ?
The teeth of the pig are, it whispers, red and brown
and recede now that they have been mentioned.
When I look close: not us. What is inexpressed?
This departure hurries by and is like the lion
who simultaneously guards the books
and elsewhere tests the river with a paw,
stone in the first and lean flesh in the other
world where the sun is blessing its glide back
into thornbushes and I am stone, guarding stone.
There is no predator I would like to be torn in half by,
from the logging road a cut like a jeweler’s work
down to the shore where the sea stars disappeared

leaving nukes and love metered and syllabary
and also the rocks they used to cling to exposed
at low tide, green clocks. At dawn a fishing boat’s
uncertain past the rock offshore, chord on chord.
Warped sexual knuckle in flushed purple
and hundreds of shades of orange, herpetic and stone
to touch, cut, they grow back, vitrified, easy to draw.
Round was the dish of mints in the conference room
where we signed over my mother’s liver,
some mints were soft and pastel, some hard
with white covering. Mint grows back in the creek.
The liver grows back too, largest organ in the body.
No, not _skin_ , mother, skin is _on_ the body —
we addressed this with the host at trivia night

no, not the one I go to each Sunday with friends,
the constant one I sleep inside of every blink.
Time’s the thing that’s not the mind
or the baby, which wants a nipple.
Time’s a baby in a sling, all the babies
in the park on blankets, beginning,
a minor electricity, water and dust
a kind of suet in a hanging cage
and is larger than whatever the universe
turns out to be (a strawberry pip)
all tough winter, which has been shown
to prosper. Seen from the past the line
is the present when the astronauts came back,
bid us bury our gravity and grow the lines

that are the story of loneliness, waste,
either enough or not enough. I walk past
the potted plants in the side alley,
marigold, sunfollower, a good plate,
give a little water, adjust the moments.
Constellation of last images before sleep:
a walk around the drained reservoir, arrival
at the island; having a theater all to yourself
and they show the movie anyway. Formless
or forming interior scrumble: the fluttering
of her eyelid is like what floats up the chimney.
Something inside is being stepped-down
to the noises from when I was here last. This time
of year you can see to the bottom of the lake.
