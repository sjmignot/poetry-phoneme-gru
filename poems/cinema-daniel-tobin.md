In the film that doesn’t begin and never ends, a man
wakes, drives to a country farmhouse where he finds
the guests he knows from his recurring dream, each

telling their own strange tale to him, the architect
called in to pitch his new design—a fratricidal son,
that ventriloquist whose dummy mouths his life—

progressive horror, till from his nightmare the man
wakes, drives to a country farmhouse where he finds
the guests he knows from his recurring dream. . . .

So with _Dead of Night,_ Bondi, Gold, and Hoyle wake
to their design, the universe a Steady State, a cloud
that never moves from its mountaintop, one droplet

added for every one lost. Or like our own bodies
freshened cell by cell, creation continuous, God-less,
and atoms bred from atoms from alchemical stars.

You drive with Hoyle in the hills above Montalcino,
the cloth merchant’s son, outspoken, caustic, truant,
who would label you comically “The Big Bang Man,”

arguing the probabilities: “What matter, Fred, creates
itself?” “Nothing, my dear Georges, then in an instant
a universe?” All that is, is, is spinning on a pencil point.

And you in his dinner portrait of you, a Friday fast,
coveting his steak, the enormous, undesired fish
appearing to stay the same size however much you eat.
