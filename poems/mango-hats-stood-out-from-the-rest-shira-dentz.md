Canary-yellow dice
aren’t what you think,

seller said in their shop
where they sold
    all things
      canary—

            whistles,
    sweets, frills, perfumes, with hints
     of cherry chance,

a throw of canary.


Much hinges
on
    canary,

Canary said
       in
        their
    shop where they sold sunny
vanes
on canary die.

    Forgive me for
showing
        myself a composed canary, live
or not.
