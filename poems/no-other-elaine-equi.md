# No Other
## Elaine Equi
I thought I had lost myself,
but I see it’s you that’s gone missing.

O always elsewhere.

What yacht or spaceship have you hijacked?

In what seedy hideaway do you scoff
at the sameness of all cities, all ideas?

Once you made me loquacious
because what’s the point in saying anything
if there isn’t the possibility of being misunderstood.

Now I am nearly speechless with boredom.
I will wait _Madame Butterfly_ -style for your return.
