# Gulls
## Kate Camp
In Homer, the gods
take the place of consciousness.

For me, it is birds.
Gray gulls

seen from above,
a tan and white pigeon

bringing amoral intelligence
to the balcony wall.

Geoff says they are really getting tough on birds
in Brighton. Bringing in a bylaw.

I remember his balcony
it’s really just the roof of the room downstairs

but when you climb out the window
you get a view of the sea

and the ferris wheel
which I believe is gone, or going

it was an eyesore
all the locals said

though I — of course —
thought it was wonderful

and the burned-down pier
out in the water.
