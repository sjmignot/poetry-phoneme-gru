# "Perhaps this verse would please you better--Sue--(2)"
## Colette Labouff Atkinson
Before boys, Susan drove me to work, for teriyaki takeout on Manchester past
Lincoln Boulevard. Inseparable, we planned winter and Easter vacations. In the
stairwell, I tried to talk. She cut me off. Her echo was loud when she said
_you can’t see yourself_. We went to see _Purple Rain_. That fall, I had
dinner with a boy. Susan was angry and told me I was wrong. I felt it was
true. Was it _that_ boy? That he had once dated someone Susan knew? We stopped
talking. We were eighteen. A decade later, I turned a corner coming out of a
bookstore and heard Susan laugh. _I know that_ , I thought, remembering how
she’d saved me from saying who I was. I circled back. She answered as she had
before we fell out. She answered with shame. _Do you remember how things
ended_ , she asked _, because of boys?_
