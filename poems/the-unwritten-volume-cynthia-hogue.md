# ("the unwritten volume")
## Cynthia Hogue
Elle’s writing her book of wisdom.
She writes until she cannot hold her pen.
The labyrinth miraculously is uncovered.

An American woman’s progressing on her knees.
She read something but not Elle’s book.
No one will read Elle’s book.

I walk the circular path, first the left side,
then the right, casting petals to the north,
east, south, and west (this intuitively).

A diminutive prelate shoos me away.
When he leaves, I return to the center.
The organist, practicing, strikes up _Phantom._

Elle says she cannot hear him.
 _Elle!_ I cry, _I cannot see you._
 _I had prayed Death spare you._

 _Remember our meal among the termites_
 _of Arcadia Street, that cottage of spirits_
 _with its riddled beams and long veranda_

 _bordered by plantain trees, and the spiral_
 _you traced for me on scrap-paper?_
 _I kept it for such a long time._

The organist, of course, is playing Bach.
A boy has scattered the petals I threw.
Elle’s voice surrounds me.

                                                                       _The
quiet hills I lift mine eyes._
