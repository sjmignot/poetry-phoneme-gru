# Elegy with a Brush Hook and Machete
## Cody Smith
For Steve
                         Remember when we almost drowned in ’03, the woods
            so thick we only knew the rainstorm by sound of thunder
and violence of the creek, how every day I’d take you to the Stop-N-Go

                         for your case of Natty Lights? Think back to
summertime,
            when after lunch you’d pull your shirt off and wring it in your
hands
and count off _one beer_ , wring some more, _two beers_ , how in July you’d
sweat

                         all the way through last night’s binge. Think back to
when
            we chopped paths across hardwood bottoms for skidders to plow
makeshift roads for Justiss Oil pumpjacks to suck black snot the earth

                         doesn’t blow. I wanted to call in sick every day, to
feel
            the sunrise through my bedroom pane instead of the company truck’s
windshield. But this isn’t about that. What was I? Eighteen? Drinking

                         creamy coffee the color of soupy dishwater, the
callouses
            of my hands sanding the white Styrofoam cup, whiskey from a flask
stirred into yours. I grew to welcome the start of a day filing blades, the
rhythm

                         I’d find scraping down, down, up and over. I didn’t
care
            like you did for squaring drill sites with double-knots of orange
flagging
for the loggers, how we kneeled, panting in the dirt, how you would pan your
head

                          to take inventory of the beech and white oaks rooted
inside
            the flagged-off square. I don’t know what it mattered, Steve,
which tree we marked for loggers to fell, which sapling we ourselves chopped

                         with machetes. Did the thicket not return what we
gave?
            Did the thorn limbs and briars not cut your flesh into estuaries
of brackish pink creeks of sweat and blood? Nothing changes much,

                         does it, Steve? I’m filing a brush hook’s edge for
the first time
            in years and still hear you yelling at me, _Not like that, Smith.
Just give
_
that damn thing to me. We spent our days counting off paces, eyeballing

                         a hundred yards within a few feet, but I don’t think
I have
            the same distance in me. If I count off these paces, where
does a record go? Those days, I dreamt that John the Revelator mistook

                         us for Death, the old Chevy a pale horse, us wheeling
those blades
            through chokecherry and wild honey locust, water vines crawling
behind us.
But I don’t know of any Hell that followed that wasn’t there before. I never

                         learned much as a surveyor that I didn’t already
know:
            how calloused hands have a way of smoothing wood, or else how
there’s
markers all over this country, how sometimes a fence is all we have to pass
down.
