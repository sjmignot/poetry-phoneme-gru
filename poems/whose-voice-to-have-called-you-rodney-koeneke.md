# whose voice to have called you
## Rodney Koeneke
Whose voice to have called you
And brought you to breathing
So mute as you tarry,
Enclosed in career?

Whose thoughts aren’t like your thoughts
But strips of bright
Silver, bringing you constants
On dead twisting paths

Till words couldn’t keep you
Collected in hours
Advanced in a body
Confused with the grass

To show us by falling
More reasons for leaving
Thought’s office to leave you
Asleep without fear
