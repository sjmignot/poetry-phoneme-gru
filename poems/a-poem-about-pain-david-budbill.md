# A Poem about Pain
## David Budbill
I can feel myself slipping away, fading away, withdrawing
from this life, just as my father did. When the pain you're in

is so great you canâ€™t think about or pay attention to anything
but your own pain, the rest of the world and all other life

don't matter.

I think about my friends with dementia, cancer, arthritis, and
how much more pain they are in than I am, but it does no good,

their pain is not mine, and therefore, no matter how magnanimous
I might want to be, their pain is not as important to me as my own.
