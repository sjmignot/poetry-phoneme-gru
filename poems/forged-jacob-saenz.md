My brother wore bags over his boots
              to keep the grease _&_ grime from his time
                           at the steel mill off the carpet  _&_ steps

he mounted, heaving each foot
              like a monster born of the grave
                           -yard shift — stiff  _&_ awkward,

his arms smeared w/dark matter,
              the lather of machine _&_ industry
                            bathing his clothes  _&_ face in a glaze

of sweat  _&_ smoke, oil  _&_ the dirt
              of what’s been done before — the work
                            of uncles  _&_ cousins who wore the same

jumpsuit, goggles  _&_ gloves to grab hold
              of cold finished bars using their backs
                             _&_ shoulders to move the weight around

w/the help of machines, the knobs
              to control the two-ton bundles
                            held by a buckle above the heads

of hard-hatted men that could snap
               _&_ let loose the mass of all that metal
                            meant to weld into a foundation,

a beginning to build upon
              when it was his time to work,
                            to clock in clean  _&_ leave

feeling filthy no matter the shift
              or stiffness in the bones creaking
                            like the wooden stairs he climbed
