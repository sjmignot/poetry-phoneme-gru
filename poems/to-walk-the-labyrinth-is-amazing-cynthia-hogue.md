# ("to walk the labyrinth is amazing")
## Cynthia Hogue
Everything looped, spiraled, circular (thought)
But the labyrinth’s not a maze but a singular way
to strike “the profoundest chord”
 _across aspire_

Those who enter the labyrinth can leave
(pilgrims sometime don’t)
(Elle did not)
Inside the largest circle

(the labyrinth itself)
splits into equal parts
(demi-arcs or waves)
No, silly, Elle whispers, _petals_

          _If measured through the centre of the petals there should be two
parts for each_
          _petal and one for the entry, but calculations from the measurements
show that_
 _this is not so. The difference is about ½”. There is no way around this
problem._

We must seek a solution
to the geometry of petals,
the consequential mystery
of Elle’s message:

 _I was sick and am not_
 _healed.     I am not blind_
 _but dead.     I am not dead_
 _but silenced.     Alone,_ in love.
