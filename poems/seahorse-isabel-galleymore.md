# Seahorse
## Isabel Galleymore
Isn’t it shocking how he speaks for her?
His thin voice wavering across the restaurant —
 _she’ll have the cod artichoke bake_.

A giggle of  bubbles comes from behind them:
a fish tank curtained with seagrass
where a seahorse is tying itself
to one of those slim, tweedy forms

like a hand shaping itself  inside another’s
the way my hand tucks into his
like a difference pretending it’s not.
