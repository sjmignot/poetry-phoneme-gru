# Some titles for my childhood memoir
## Nina Powles
After Kristen Sze-Tu
the likelihood of forgetting

the dress she wore when she was young

the road to Likas Bay

pictures fell down in the earthquake

we could keep them

we could throw them all away

everything I never asked my grandmother

I can understand but I canâ€™t speak

no one has played that piano since

New Zealand is so far away from here

let me translate for you the poem on the wall
