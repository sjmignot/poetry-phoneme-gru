# The Long Evenings of Their Leavetakings
## Eavan Boland
My mother was married by the water.
She wore a gray coat and a winter rose.

She said her vows beside a cold seam of the Irish coast.

She said her vows near the shore where
the emigrants set down their consonantal _n_ :

on after _n_ oo _n_ , on the e _n_ d of everything, at the start of _ever_.

Yellow vestments took in light.
A chalice hid underneath its veil.

Her hands were full of calla and cold-weather lilies.

The mail packet dropped anchor.
A black-headed gull swerved across the harbor.

Icy promises rose beside a crosshatch of ocean and horizon.

I am waiting for the words of the service. I am waiting for
_keep thee only_ and _all my earthly_.

All I hear is an afternoonâ€™s worth of _never_.
