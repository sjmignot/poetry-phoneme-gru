They so liked breast milk;
Joanne fell asleep & leaked,
the ants woke up, made the sweet climb.

Others were surprised to find
acidophilus, Soledad cleansing
her inside sex — they made their way

across her ivory sheets while she napped.
Ah, the little guys were rejected
by our sisters. But still, I feel

sad that in my new lodgings there
are no more glossy arrowheads to follow,
sprinkle with baking powder,

make a pretty cayenne path for
over the once-food-strewn
sill (they scent our past).

They can carry
their groceries
bag-free: & ants shop

in the honey cupboard,
thirst
like black hair being washed

in a sink. Car-waxed
black traffic jam — that’s
actual jam, strawberry.

Once my curatorial staff.
But let them go on strike.
Those embodiments of intention;

they don’t sit around playing
cards; perhaps they never
play, never horse

around. Hard-to-see-in-the-dark
jet numbers
on the radio dial.

Perhaps there is no laughter
in their chasm. Serious:
but they’re able to stand up on hind legs —

a darling trick.
I want to give them
a little inkwell. A beachball.

The number of communal legs alone
exceeds the stars
underground.

They could be an orchestra.
A single one looks in the mirror
& sees a note. A quarter note.

So many instincts
massing as one. If I miss one little lover,
do I miss them all?
