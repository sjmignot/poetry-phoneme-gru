# Awl
## Naomi Cohn
A tool for piercing holes. Particularly in leather. A simple metal shaft. A
knob of wood for handle, polished by its fit in the sinewy cradle of a
leather-worker’s  palm. Likely the tool with which Louis Braille blinded
himself as a child in France. An accident in his father’s saddle-making shop
in the early years of the nineteenth century. Braille later invented a system
of raised dots as a means of reading and writing for the blind. We don’t know
much. Whether he was in the shop with his father or snuck in alone. Whether it
was damp and rainy or whether the sun shone and brought to life the floating
dust that always hung in the workshop air. Maybe it was just a little poke in
the eye. A small tool, a small slip of the hand, a small injury. How a little
fumble ends in blindness. It was decades before general anesthetic or
antiseptics. Perhaps the doctor they rushed him to believed in the value of
“laudable pus” in a wound. I don’t want to picture it. As a child, playing in
his father’s saddle-making shop, did Louis Braille already know the names of
the parts of a saddle—cantle, pommel, stirrup, tree? Did he know the smell and
feel of each grade of leather? Of all the tools—punch and pincers, gouge and
groover, chisel and awl—he chose awl. Likely the last thing he saw, a shine of
metal galloping toward his eye. Is it accident that my tool for pressing hand-
punched Braille is so much like a blunt, very small awl?
