# Sweet Scent
## Angela C. Trudell Vasquez
I can smell the sweet scent of my own sweat
as I blow high with the breeze and swing,
I pump my legs like a child again my skinny kid’s butt
holds me down, keeps me grounded
when adults threaten to pull me off.
My chain breaks as I tempt to kiss the sun,
my knees have a life of their own bending
as if my very existence depended on it,
and it does, for I’d rather be a nut flying high
over people’s heads than on the ground dying
touching the earth, staining the water
with my unclean mind, my hands washing red
off the money so I can sleep off my power trip
and back stabbing toys.
I was an old soul at five spouting off
about the filth of my generation.
I knew greed was the root of all evil,
competition in close cousin.
I had my doubts about civilization as I found it
and convinced my sister Tricia to wear
flannel jammies zipped to the throat in the summer
to protect us from the babysitter’s bloodsucking
husband while our parents went out for supper.
