# Pink Slip at Tool & Dye
## Dave Smith
He can only drink tea now, screwed and filed.
She is dead, in metal flecks.

 _55 years old and look like a bad nail
_
by God they yanked me out
I can tell you


_soon as the hurt come son shut up
_
it don’t mean nothing


_but listen: you got time for a ride?_


Habit’s put the glass in his hands, the brown
tasteless tea, slime, and cigarettes.
Every Sunday the same, old dog
fat at his feet.

 _Ain’t so much me I’m asking for
_
dog like to get out and piss
think they remember.


Near the main gate of Gary Steel I stop.
The amber light pours out of stacked horizons,
monstrous cranes hang over suburbs.

 _She think that piss mean something
_
it don’t mean nothing.


Turning back in the dark, headlights flash
on our faces, bent, light of a woman’s hair.
