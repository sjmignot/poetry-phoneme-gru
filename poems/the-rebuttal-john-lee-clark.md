# The Rebuttal
## John Lee Clark
An erasure of Lydia Huntley Sigourney's "On Seeing the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind
Girl, Sitting for Her Portrait"
Guide, passion, catch what
Hath no speech. Unknown
Joys, power, and meditationâ€™s
Unfolding sky. Feeling draws
Heart and wildering language
Still without speech to
Mind. Philosophy fails to
Sway this future child.
