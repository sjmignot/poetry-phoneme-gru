# Love Lessons in a Time of Settler Colonialism
## Tanaya Winder
I am not murdered, and I am not missing, but parts of me have been
disappeared.
-- Leanne Simpson
They too know all too well that some cracks were built just for us to fall
through.  We live in a world that tries to steal spirits each day; they steal
ours by taking us away.

From Industrial Schools to forced assimilation, genocide means removal  of
those who birth nations — our living threatens. Colonization has been choking

us for generations. I tell my girls they are vessels of spirit, air to lungs
expanding; this world cannot breathe without us. There are days  I wish

I didn’t have to teach these lessons, but as an Indigenous womxn  silence is
deadening. There is danger in being seen, our bodies are targets

marked for violence. We carry the Earth’s _me too_ inside us,  a howling wind,
our mothers  & their mothers swallowed these bullets long ago.

The voices ricochet _I wish I were invisible I wish I were invisible  I wish_
echoes  in my eardrums — we know what it’s like to live in fear. Colonialism’s
bullet sits cocked,

waiting behind a finger on trigger. We breathe and speak and sing  for
survival. We carve out in lines; we write —  _I know joy I know pain I know
love_

 _I know love I know_  — lessons we’ve carried throughout time. Should I go
missing: don’t stop searching; drag every river until it turns red and the
waters of our names

stretch a flood so wide it catches everything. And we find each other whole
and sacred, alive and breathing and breathing and breathing.
