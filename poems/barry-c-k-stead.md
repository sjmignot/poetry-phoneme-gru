Later, lying on the lawn of the big house
someone asked could we remove our jackets.
No one had taken charge
we were young officers
and I took mine off.

And then (or earlier)
we were in the battle zone
taking cover behind parked cars
postboxes, phone booths
and in abandoned trams
when my friend took one full in the chest
and went down without a word.
“Way to go,” I thought
and imagined the sniper reporting “I got one”
and being doubted
but I could have attested to it
the perfect shot.

And then the shelling and the strafing began.

Later I wrote a report (I was good at that)
and I remembered lying out on the lawn
of the big house
that was called “Mandalay”
in the hot sun
and Barry asking about our jackets
and I removing mine
and Ian saying “In the enemy army
you could be shot for that.”

The battle zone wasn’t always a city
sometimes it was jungle
where our first foes were mosquitoes
who took our blood
and flew away with it
like bees, Barry joked
taking pollen
from the full flower of our youth.
