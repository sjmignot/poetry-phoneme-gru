# Mother's Blessing
## Eleanor Ross Taylor
This timeless blood was here before _begat_.
     Infinity runs in your veins—
        Not mine, nor yours,
             Nor Eve’s, not Adam’s—
                  Gat of God,
                       And spinning like taffy Godwards back again.
Sapped through the centuries to us—
     Grafting a limb there for the Jesse tree—
        Remultiplied infinitely,
             From heart to heart tick-pulsed,
                  Ill clad, ill fed, ill fit—
                       Here, child, do what you can with it.
