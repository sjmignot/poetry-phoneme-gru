# Three Women
## Olivia Maciel
Three women survive.
One hides in a bedroom of a house,
sharpening blades in the bathroom, her night.
Another disinfects the cloth her older sister contaminates.
The third, more tender and insecure, proud and serene,
        takes her first steps,
surrounded by palm trees, lemon trees, pomegranate trees,
        bougainvilleas, birds of paradise...
