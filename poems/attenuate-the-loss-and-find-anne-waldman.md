# Attenuate the Loss and Find
## Anne Waldman
For Adrienne Rich

[Our burden to carry as she did
shift the weight of song, heft and gnosis
"body poetics"
as a total event
her fullness rare in the amnesiac Kulchur
awake, awareness & urgency when poetry serves]
name appears
everywhere and in dream
body armor removed

what now, legacy, _archivum_
we female archons preserve of
intensity a durance a hand you recognize
( _sounds sound_ )
assurance as lives on

drank of that
drank of this
almost suffocated, then drowned
downed but never

what only she could only know
as herself living in the brute time

speak of a syntax of rendition?
the politics of Empire chip away
as poetry attests, _give it up_

curve of a water-starved globe
to follow and be following?

racism, sexism, struggle

everything in intense grasp of
consciousness — cut in crystal observation
for her rapid and perched _intellectus_
privacy opens to vibrant light

this is stuff of Eros, of empathy
passionate edge of Adrienne
the American Skeptic

I feel you _consociational_ in this light
a term of anthropology, to study
intersections in the annals we share

intergenerational, interspecies, interlanguage

move in parallelograms

getting it right as she did
