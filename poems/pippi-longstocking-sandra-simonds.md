# Pippi Longstocking
## Sandra Simonds
    Is it Spanish?
No, Swedish.
       What’s that?
Where Loki came from.

Writing about Ragnarök
in the purple octopi
     of a gel pen, it’s the end
       of the world and a gigantic wolf

is going to swallow
     the coagulated sun whole.
Myth, wish fulfillment. He broke
   the strongest chains ever built.

He was strong.
He won.
I’m not strong.
I don’t win.

Pippi is strong too.
And smart.

Sit with me, little one,
inside this mansion
     of June hieroglyphics, inside
the belles lettres of fluttering
     paper-doll tomorrrows,

and mourn
    how we never lived.
