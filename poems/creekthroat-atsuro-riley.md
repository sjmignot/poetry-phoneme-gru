# Creekthroat
## Atsuro Riley
 -- We seen his mama she dry and scant
By hook or by bent
I guttle the rudimental stories.


I’m all in-scoop
suck and swallow by dint of birth. Of shape.


— Were _you_ hallow-nursed on riversource
upon a time (or ‘ _the rocky breasts forever_ ’) I was not.


I learned to lie in want
for succor-food; for forms; I lunged I gulped for what I got.


Nowadays to need
to come by what comes by here comes natural and needs no bait.


 _Just steep dead-still as a blacksnake
_
creek and wait.


                        [ _my chokesome weeds, my crook, my lack, my
epiphytes,_ _my cypress knees    ..._ ]


This old appetite as chronic as tides —
on foot or by boat by night ( _please_ ) come slake me with radicle stories.
