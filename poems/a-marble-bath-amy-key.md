# A marble bath
## Amy Key
she at last
had permission to use
the marble bath
for the marble bath
she untied a paper bag
of periwinkle bath salts
& flicked them into the water
as though cracking a whip
she untied her hair
she untidied her hair
tested the water
with the soft pads of her toes
(tips of bladder wrack
in the sun)
her skin her markings
(as for the bath) —
interior-of-Stilton
at last underwater
she drew breath
from every shell collected
from every beach
later in the evening
when dressed for bed
she rejoined her brothers
& sister &
they were each served
a portion of the last portion
