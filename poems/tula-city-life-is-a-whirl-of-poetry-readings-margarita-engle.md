# Tula ["City life is a whirl of poetry readings"]
## Margarita Engle
City life is a whirl of poetry readings
and forbidden _tertulias_ , gatherings
where young and old, rich and poor,
male and female, dark and light—
runaway slaves and freed ones,
former masters and former
servants—all take turns
sharing secret verses
rooted in startling
new ideas.

Each evening, I go home
with a mind that glows
in the light of words,
which leap
like flames...
