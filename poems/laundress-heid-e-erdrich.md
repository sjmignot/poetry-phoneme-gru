# Laundress
## Heid E. Erdrich
Given over to love,
she un-balls the socks,

lets fall debris of days,
leaf litter, sand grain,

slub of some sticky substance,
picks it all for the sake

of the stainless tub
of the gleaming new front loader.

Given over to love long ago, when her own
exasperated moan bounced off

the quaint speckled enamel
of the top loader

vowing: she'd do this always and well.
She fell in love then, she fell in lineâ€”

in a march of millions, you pair them,
two by two, you marry the socks.
