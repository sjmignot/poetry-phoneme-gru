# Ledger
## Jenny Xie
The Sangre de Cristo Mountains mottled as if with oil stains. Configurations
of cloud-shadows.

Easy gait of hours: a way through — or into — the dry winds.

 _Our church is the mountains_ , says the guide to the tour group, all of whom
have been instructed to keep their cameras inside their bags.  A group
crowding the aisles of San Geronimo Chapel.

On the dirt path between adobe structures, bareheaded. Stretching, palms out,
as steam from the boiling pot does.

To move along the earth without keeping a ledger.

The horsefly not so incongruous with the sagebrush. Still, reflexive swatting.

 _We’re good citizens, we serve in the Army, though we’re regarded as second
class by the US government._

Framed badges and news stories in the house of the retired sheriff. Men in his
family who have been policemen, firemen, soldiers. His wife pinching the ears
of bear sculptures formed from mica clay.

Thick paste of red soil and the piñon that pierces through it.

To carry on from day to day without exercising the sloppy hand of
manipulation.

Four dollars for a plate of fry bread in cinnamon butter. The boy at the
counter restless, wanting to get back to the electronic dance  music on pause
on his iPhone.

Reading a history backward, the deep strata.

Settling on this life as a parasite on its host.

 _That man next door who you bought from? He sells jewelry made by an Anglo
woman. His wife._

The stray dog asleep on her side, dreams ripped from her open jaw.

Money touched from hand to hand.

Whole lifetimes spent trying to make sense of an appetite.

A town called Tres Orejas. _Three ears_. Plenty.
