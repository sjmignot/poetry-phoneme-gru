# Harold's Chicken Shack #86
## Nate Marshall
we're trying to eliminate the shack.
 -- Kristen Pierce, Harold's CEO & daughter of founder Harold Pierce
when i went to summer camp the white kids had a tendency
to shorten names of important institutions. make Northwestern
University into _NU_. international relations into _IR_. everybody
started calling me _Nate_. before this i imagined myself

 _Nathaniel A_. maybe even _N. Armstead_ to big up my granddad.
i wrote my whole name on everything. eventually i started
unintentionally introducing myself as _Nate_. it never occurred
to me that they could escape the knowing of my name’s
real length. as a shorty

most the kids in my neighborhood couldn’t say my name.
 _Mick-daniel, Nick-thaniel, MacDonnel_ shot across the courts
like wild heaves toward the basket. the subconscious visual
of a chicken shack seems a poor fit for national expansion.

Harold’s Chicken is easier, sounds like Columbus’s flag stuck
into a cup of cole slaw. shack sounds too much like home
of poor people, like haven for weary
like building our own.
