# American Dream
## Emily Jungmin Yoon
The alcove of your arm
has become my favorite room
for sleep, but I’ve been roused
by nightmares lately. _Even thunderstorms
_
couldn’t wake you, my mother says
over the phone. I want to tell her
I’ve been seeing a white man, an American
man, but I can already imagine her:
 _Well, you can have friends_. She had never meant
for me to become a Westerner —
she’s afraid of losing me to a _foreigner_ , being unable to speak
to her future grandchildren. Thousands of miles away
in Korea she asks if anything is wrong. I want to laugh.
Say to you, _Isn’t she ridiculous_? But
last night a Korean man broke into your room
and raped me, with you calm in your repose
next to me. He sat on my stomach with a knife,
the only gleaming thing. And you were still
in your platinum skin when I opened my eyes. _How
_
can anything be wrong, I comfort my mother.
