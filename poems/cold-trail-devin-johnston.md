# Cold Trail
## Devin Johnston
The feeling of time derives from heat,
an agitation of molecules,
oracles from the friction of air
through fissures and the leaves of oaks.
A few gnats stitch the lake’s edge
where a fox turns off the gravel road
to nose through rhododendron
as children crawl through winter coats
to reach a closet’s dark recess.
Dawdling at the edge of sleep
you work through problems already past
though unresolved, a notional path,
a crease through heads of wild blue phlox
that waking, you can’t follow.
