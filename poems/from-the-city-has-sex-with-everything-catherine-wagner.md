# From "The city has sex with everything"
## Catherine Wagner
the city has sex with megan

 when the air shaped like the inverse of Megan
accepts Megan as she moves.

    If Megan is a system of exchange
that floats her labor and her point

  of view in vapor/liquid soup
passàging through her valves

and if her later corpse, collapsing,
 updates its inversion of the air

 even more than did the air displace
when she grew from brown-eyed baby

into strong laboring woman in blue jeans
  and heathered wool,

and if the air and earth draw from Megan’s corpse
  all the energy and minerals

 she pulled from her surrounds
to build her nails and bones and teeth—

 if the exchange doesn’t stop
but only ceases to support her consciousness,

 and if her consciousness was corpse anyway until
it found relation,

 then what demises
is the potential for the human social,

and another sociality
 will unbutton my whole shoe

and tongue hang limp,
  what sex is for but stops me

 at the barrier, a pixelated
glamour reef though very

   close and simple, smell a
  flurry, parapluie paraphrase,

 energy funneled through a shape.
You filtered chemical

 information in such a pointy
fulgent scrambled way, in the city

    and outside the city in the vernal zones
   and aqua zones the city shaped, flow-charted, realist

 trucked. The city caved under
     when the zones rose and lapped around the pilings,

 manged foundations green,
      rotted the teeth out of the mouth of the city,

 harbor high-rises
dark and blown. The city is extremely fragile tender

 human mesh and will be mush
    and mushrooms grow in, there is room in, ruins

roam the rearticulated harm.



speech by a flaneur—no a flaneuse—

On my face, D. folliculorum are relaxing
 like Tenniel caterpillars leaning on mushroom stalks
  against the bases of my hair follicles
 which provide shelter and shade.
These critters are peculiar to
   the ecology of the human face
     which I take around the city
     open, close   it is my means
    of feeding   I rely on
  changing its shape
in response to others’ faces and postures
  to reduce my risk and increase my safety
   and my likelihood of being
    included in the group’s collective
      life. I smile a lot and hope it
     don’t look fake.
