# Auricle
## Dan Beachy-Quick
I listen and listen but how do I know
 _Peace Peace in the plural says please or pleads_
I hear the whole song divide the state as one
 _appeals past the last centuries’ pealing bells_
wren under eaves ruins another wren’s heaven
 _dying sympathies appear as a pear or peas_
with her territory her tune I want a nest
 _clinging to the twine Please Please in the plural_
not a flag a mead hall not a circumstance
 _puts pain’s poor plea deeper in the apparent_
a stable not a stability where animals dream
 _pressure the daylily plant the possible prayer_
and dreaming among them I tell the stranger
 _pulling apart the sepal petals by their dusty crease_
in my mind I can’t I don’t know how to sing
