# Terra Pericolosa
## Celina Su
To map the consequences of  _regardless_ , of  _underestimate_ ,
   Of feverish faith, of the mechanical modernism of your false terrain. As if
Port Sulphur remained nominal, its slick globules merely figurative
      Between territories of  _wait_  and wetlands of  _trust_.

To etch the shallow-water horizon— a techno-utopian tribute
         To shrimp estuaries, bird rookeries, oyster bays,
To tube worms  & sea turtles. To watercolor these pelican grasses,
            Oxidized, unapologetic executive marshes, roseated spoonbills.

For you who longed to smear concentric circles,
            To have trusted you with longitude and latitude,
To blur this sargassum border between mourning,
               Fighting, and willful denying of objects and subjects. As if

Generations of fishermen, scaling orders of magnitude,
                  Navigated oily streaks of miles in a legend of inches,
Skeletal, ghostly swarms of now-opaque, milky jellyfish. As if
                     to bury the blowout, rescind the rig. To fortify, to
intone.

If naming were not violence,  _to witness_  an active verb:
 _Top kill, junk shot, top hat, dance dance revolution_.
These wayward scripts a  _frontier province_  palimpsest.
                        Offshore yet another beacon, another account.
Explosive violet iridescent.
