                                 Could’ve been an outfit for the Whitney
Biennial

                                 Couldn’t afford one, nor did I need it.

                                 Who cares how you look at the zoo;

                                 it’s about the animals, stupid. Which reminds
me,

                                 could’ve been the trail mix I snacked on

                                 & which I managed _not_ to purchase myself.



                                 It was tuna on whole wheat, lettuce,
jalapeños;

                                 a one liter bottle of water (Poland Spring.)

                                 Asked for tomato too, which the lady forgot.

                                 You Puerto Rican, she asked? Don’t think so,

                                 said another one in Spanish. Let me answer.

                                 No, what made you think so? The peppers?
