It was not Death, for I stood up,
And all the Dead, lie down -
It was not Night, for all the Bells
Put out their Tongues **Tongues** The clappers inside of the bells , for Noon.

It was not Frost, for on my Flesh
I felt Siroccos **Siroccos** Hot winds. The Emily Dickinson Lexicon includes
definitions from the American Dictionary of the English Language (1844): “A
pernicious wind that blows from the south-east in Italy, called the Syrian
wind. It is said to resemble the steam from the mouth of an oven.” \- crawl -
Nor Fire - for just my marble feet
Could keep a  Chancel, **Chancel** The section near the altar of a church cool
-

And yet, it tasted, like them all,
The Figures I have seen
Set orderly, for Burial
Reminded me, of mine -

As if my life were shaven,
And fitted to a frame,
And could not breathe without a key,
And ’twas like Midnight, some -

When everything that ticked - has stopped -
And space stares - all around -
Or Grisly frosts - first Autumn morns,
Repeal the Beating Ground -

But most, like Chaos - Stopless - cool -
Without a Chance, or  spar **spar** The top mast of a ship  -
Or even a Report of Land -
To justify - Despair.
