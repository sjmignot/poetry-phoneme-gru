# Rilke Rereading Holderlin
## George Kalogeris
Footnotes to the tower. For “He spends the summer
There, in a state of violent agitation,”
Read: “It’s there, in his agitation’s most violent
State that Hölderlin suspends the summer” —
Like a yellow pear above the untroubled water.

For the lost, disheveled decades of derangement,
Translate _I was struck by Apollo_ as you
Must change your life. For sonnets that sing their own
Spontaneous, Orphic necessity to praise,
Think naked as a lightning rod he waited.

For necessity insert _Anangke_. But for
 _Anangke_ , “Lord, just one more summer, please.”
For summer, the lyre. Hölderlin in his tower.
Until autumn, when the leaves start falling. Whoever
Has nowhere to go will never get home now.
