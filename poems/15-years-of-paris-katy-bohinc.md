                                                 the Catacombs)
You’re leaving Las Vegas, except
In German. Point. Point. Point.
Gave it out, beautiful _gentilhomme_
 _Comme vous_ _êtes, toujours_ ,
Unforgettable, circa 2008 how
You made me cum like that -
She got so mad in the bed - the
Hotel bathroom floor,
The bathtub, the apartment where
I was the crying queen

Those o’s still unforgettable
And now Paris. I cried today OW!
Your Antarctica cold last
Night. You told me they fucked
You up / I told you he broke
My heart and OW! Freeze
Dried my bandaid right off.
And then the glasses shopping
Memories today yada yada
Wasn’t about the cum shot
Where or if, was about the
Islands and how you said
in the _langue d’enemie_
No less: “DON’T TOUCH”

Don’t Touch!? We just …
They fucked you up all right.
You give so clearly but have iced
Out all the incoming gifts. WELL
PING my darling Walden island.
I can’t take that kind of cold.
 _I’m_ leaving Las Vegas.
Just a moon in Taurus trying
To sing the sweet and
It’s not a great user experience

But I just want you to know
How unforgettable you are


When the candles call to Hera
I hope they melt your
I hope a goddess or many
Wash that loneliness away
And when I see you again (in 15 years)
There’s only joy and more

I prefer you laughing to tears
The good way. Drink us when
We’re done. Well, I guess I did
Almost kill you with a
Razor shave once so it
Seems silly to say I’m sorry I
Lost the phantom thread.
Maybe everything’s a ridiculous
never-ending non-planet
Tho, u did kiss me like unicorns
Exist and bond our skin
Like the organ it deserves to be
Known as


To know how unforgettable
you are because there
lies the bridge to the
Mainland.  & baby, you
Deserve it all.
