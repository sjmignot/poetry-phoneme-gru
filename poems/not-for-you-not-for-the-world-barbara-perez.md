# Not for You, Not for the World
## Barbara Perez
Because a little reprieve, a little hope (even for those whom I love)
would exculpate the world of  its actions, I hold to logic steadfast.
Belief, without knowledge, dislodges perception of all the empirical world
— (even for you, mom and dad). Know that if, for you, on some filthy lie
I could wish for the mind’s persistence after death, I would say no.
