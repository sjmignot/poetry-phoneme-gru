I fed my father what
as it turned out the future
would call his last meal
(tho at the time neither
he nor I was required to
think it that exactly)—
ground chourico & chopped
green pepper open-faced
on a burger bun, french fries,
a cupcake with icing almost
chocolate in flavor—alarming,
a departure from his diet
of low-sodium, zeroed-out
trans fats & sugar-free
vegetables with high fiber-
scores, suffering as he had
been for years from barbarian
cholesterol & geriatric
diabetes (the nurse shrugged
simply & said "why not?"—
meaning of course that
we should get it, all of us,
he _was_ going to die,
and soon). A few loose
chitters of ground sausage
fell onto his johnnie
from the fork I lifted
to his mouth—they left
tiny, paprika-red dots
of oil on the sheer cotton,
prussic red, corpuscle red
like the small scabs my sister
and I had left on his face
while helping him shave
the day before. A week earlier
I had visited him at home;
the day an unusually warm
day in a March unusually
cold. He was telling me how
he'd gone out into the yard
to get some sun only to return
minutes later to the house,
the wind far too strong—
he said he worried that
if the wind took his hat
from his head, he might
die while chasing it.
I made a joke—forced to,
I thought—chasing a hat,
I said, that might be
a better death than most,
I said maybe the death
certificate would read "killed
by the wind." He laughed
all right. You know, he said,
you've really got a lousy
sense of humor. Better than
nothing, I guess—(did _he_
say _that,_ or did I think
it?). Later he said . . . he'd said
earlier . . . then I said . . . he
said . . . I said . . . I said . . .
I said . . . Say now that
this might be all that's left
for consolation, this
might be love at the end,
the confidences exchanged—
all these pratfalls,  & this
skin chapped by a blade,
and your willing servant's
shaky hands, then a short
trip to be washed a last,
finally blameless time
(so the scriptures say)
in the blood of the lamb:
a smell like the smell of
sweetgrass burning crosswise
the length of a dry plain
and sent by a wind whose
swiftness has in it the bright
voices of kindergarteners, children
born of a hardship town.
