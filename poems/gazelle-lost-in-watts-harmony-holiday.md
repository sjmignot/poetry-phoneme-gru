# Gazelle Lost in Watts
## Harmony Holiday
I saw you painted on a ghetto wall last summer and thought _don’t submit to
this medium_     ...    everybody’s running into the wall or running into each
other and plagiarizing our future like mummies and nukes, I watched you hug
the _Mona Lisa_. I wanna use the word pariah until it shrugs for us and even
their disguises go limp as a fire tumbling down a hillside into the
playfulness in my heart, acres and acres of a lean, almost spiritual vibe
afraid of  its own momentum and then not afraid again
