# Because I Will Be Silenced
## Ha Jin
Once I have the freedom to say
my tongue will lose its power.
Since my poems strive to break the walls
that cut off peopleâ€™s voices,
they become drills and hammers.

But I will be silenced.
The starred tie around my neck
at any moment can tighten into a cobra.

How can I speak about coffee and flowers?
