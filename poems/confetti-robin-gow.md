# confetti
## Robin Gow
it started with the first time
i opened the closet in my new
bedroom. paper flecks bursting from
behind the door. they had been waiting
all millennia. you helped
me pick them from my hair but even
weeks later we’d still find pieces
in between teeth — under tongues —
on shoulders & lodged beneath fingernails.
you were always so gentle as you’d release
them out the window — same as you’d do
for a spider. when finished with
a rainbow it is the task of the youngest
angel to put it through the paper shredder.
he crouches in the cloud mist — taking
handfuls of the body’s remnants.
he learns not to weep after years of practice.
the first rainbow he shredded was that one
that we tried to follow in your car —
driving around wet fallen trees — mist
rising from the asphalt. we never did get there
but we did stop for ice cream. you bit
the bottom off the cone. the sound
of the rainbow’s destruction was only a dull
static noise to us down here. i noticed
it but didn’t want to tell you. the next
time i was tearing open what looked like
a credit card offer in the mail & out
came the confetti. we had just stopped finding
it on everything — gushing like an artery
i covered my face until it was through.
mounds upon mounds of color. stole the rake
from my aunt’s shed we had used to rake leaves
in early october before the weather gave
herself over to frost. i resisted the impulse
to make the confetti into piles to leap into.
you were coming over & i wanted to be
clean. the next time we slept together
i transported myself somewhere else as you kissed me.
sat on the collarbone of the rainbow as
it was shred along with my hair. me, with the
thousand-piece body. me, getting blown
away by the first breeze. me, inhaling
the tears of the kneeling angel. i came
back to the room when you knelt,
spitting paper out of your mouth. confetti began to
pour out from behind my lips, miraculously dry.
each time i tried to apologize more came out;
you, naked on the bedroom floor trying to dispose
of the colors as they came. flow mountain spring.
flow slit neck of a pig. flash flood &
flow melted ice cream down to our elbows.
by the time it stopped your fear turned to anger.
slammed the door as you left & there i
was with all this color. i put some in my mouth
but it was too bitter too swallow.
if i don’t kiss anyone this won’t happen again —
i can keep it a beautiful secret. routine:
each morning removing the piles of cut paper.
when you come over i sometimes find them on your
skin. you don’t notice so i kiss them off
your neck. i’m trying i’m trying.
i peel the rainbows free & roll them up like
yoga mats in the closet. the shredding has
gotten so loud — i ask you if you hear
it & you shake your head, unknowingly.
i can’t stand it — i can’t stand it.
caress this color out of me.
