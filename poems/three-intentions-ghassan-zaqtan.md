# Three Intentions
## Ghassan Zaqtan
      1
I will cry to regret
and slaughter my heart
on a desolate rock in the steppe
and run in the wilderness run
in their illusions in the mirrors
of bullets while shooing
victory and defeat
and also the dead
with war's twig

    2
I will arch my back like a noble wolf
and howl in the plains
until the plains go mad
and the god of soldiers spots me lifeless
in war's meanness
I'd be pleased yet angry
and forlorn of seas that have tolled
for thirty centuries
they come and go

     3
I call to my friend
and leave him standing in speech
I call to my lover
and leave her insomniac
