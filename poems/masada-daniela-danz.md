# Masada
## Daniela Danz
And then when you stand where it is quiet so that
you notice when thought ends and
listening begins when listening ends
and seeing begins when a bird
flies when you glide as a black bird
and scream when you start to speak
in the clear air and can speak of nothing
but the light as if it were the first
light when you cast a shadow
on the rock and say my shadow stays
and the rock passes away when at this moment
it is true that it is good to attempt the entire mission
you can call the desert by its name
