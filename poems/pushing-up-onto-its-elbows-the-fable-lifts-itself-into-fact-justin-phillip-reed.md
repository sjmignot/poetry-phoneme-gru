# Pushing Up Onto Its Elbows, the Fable Lifts Itself Into Fact.

after Tafisha Edwards
To disappear Black girls at a low volume of sustained public panic is to
insinuate the inconstancy of Black girls. The disposability of Black girls who
are prone to disappearance. A body bag somewhere waits with little hoopla
about its lot. Absence becomes the lot of Black girls.

_________ will eventually accept as fact that absence becomes a lot of Black
girls. In what becomes the normal day-to-day, Black girls are harder to find,
_________ would think first, not that there are few attempts to find them. The
question isn’t whether Black girls often go missing. If no one else, Black
girls miss each other.

_________  would be remiss to not recognize how everything is made less in the
absence of Black girls, if _________ could miss what _________ have never been
required to recognize, such as:

Unlike missing Black girls, taking Black girls is a Western custom. It seems
likely that such a statement will soon appear inaccurate: the white space in
new textbook editions will have nothing to say about it, if the white spaces
behind those textbooks have anything to say about it. That Black girls are
quintessential American palimpsests is not a question but an anxiety.
_________ would rather forget that Black girls were made receptacles for what
the authors of  _Liberty_  and  _Independence_  would not speak. That
_Liberty_  and  _Independence_  were imaginable only in the absent-presence of
taken Black girls, enslaved Black girls, Black girls on whom a foundational
economic system so depended that white men would kill each other and take
taken Black girls.

The constancy of Black girls is someone’s anxiety. The soil is thick with
hidden Black girls, the myth that only quiet Black girls are worthwhile Black
girls. The soil turns as _________  turn away from loud Black girls and their
cacophonic insistence on Black girls.

_________ have not insisted enough upon the fact of Black girls, are often
loudly shocked to find Black girls disappeared. Loud, unsustainable shock has
a way of disappearing Black girls. Outrage, too, has a way of being
disappeared.
