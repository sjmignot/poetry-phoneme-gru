# I Promise You
## John Lee Clark
thereâ€™s nothing in my face. There is nothing in yours. What we have are called
heads. They are nothing unless we kiss. Lips are wonderful. They are full of
mechanoreceptors. In the Old World we all used to kiss and kiss. It was then
that we did have faces. We had noses and cheeks and foreheads and soft, downy
hair. In the New World we stopped kissing. Those who were already here
stopped. Those who came stopped. Now there are only four people who have heads
that are also faces. They are an artist and three children for whom I have a
face other than my hands.
