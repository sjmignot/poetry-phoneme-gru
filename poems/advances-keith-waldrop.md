# Advances
## Keith Waldrop
seventy wingbeats
per second

vagaries of vegetation, rosy
anticipation _I_
 _turn the page without_
 _reading_

essence of
accident

what is the strongest
motive what
drives the solar wind

time’s not so
old, dating only
from the creation

New England has
cooled significantly, icy
core with a sooty coating

this ice
hard to break—the brain
will have to wait

catharsis of the
vulture, obligatory
vespers

a bat, painted the
color of joy, head
downward because

the brain is
heavy _I put on_
 _music but don’t always_
 _listen_

whether magma could
rise to where tones reach
audible frequencies

modest success with a late
parasitic moth _we will soon_
 __
_find out if all this_
 _is true_

sudden drain on the
heart, more
doubt, the big

melt: anything
gone is
replaced
