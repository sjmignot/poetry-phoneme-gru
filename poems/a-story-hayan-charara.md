# A Story
## Hayan Charara
Some will call the suicide bomber
a coward but seeing him

you think only, _Hungry,_
stumbling as he is toward you,

to the tent where pilgrims
stop to eat and drink.

Behind you a woman in a black robe
scoops rice with her fingers.

Beside her a girl, restless, runs out
onto the dusty two-lane road

that the bomber now crosses.
This is happening

at the end
of forty days of mourning,

the anniversary a martyrdom.
The girl returns breathless

and the mother gives her
a glass of clean water.

You watch the ripple down
her throat, and out of sunlight

the man approachesâ€”
his eyes, like yours, are brown.

Now you hear someone say, _Sit, sit._
It is the mother talking to the daughter.

And now someone is shouting,
and now there is the terrible noise.

Every person is a story.
You are the man who walked out

as he walked in, the bomb went off,
and you lived to tell.
