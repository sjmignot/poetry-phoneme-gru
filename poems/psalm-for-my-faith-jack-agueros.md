# Psalm For My Faith
## Jack Agüeros
Lord, it’s not true
That my faith is cooling.
It’s just that people
Are saying that candle smoke
Has caused cancer in church mice.
And I also worry that candle light
Is too weak to reach your cloud.

Do I need a hydrogen candle?
Are the Angels into lasers?

Lord, as I think about it,
Lately I haven’t had much to thank you for.

Are you on vacation?
