# O, She Says
## Hailey Leithauser
_O_ , she says (because she loves to say _O_ ),
 _O_ to this cloud-break that ravels the night,
_O_ to this moon, its mouthful of sorrow,
 _O_ shallow grass and the nettle burr’s bite,

 _O_ to heart’s flare, its wobbly satellite,
_O_ step after step in stumbling tempo,
 _O_ owl in oak, _O_ rout of black bat flight,
( _O_ moaned in Attic and Esperanto)

 _O_ covetous tongue, _O_ fat fandango,
 _O_ gnat tango in the hot, ochered light,
 _O_ wind whirred leaves in subtle inferno,
 _O_ flexing of sea, _O_ stars bolted tight,

 _O_ ludicrous swoon, _O_ blind hindsight,
 _O_ torching of bridges and blood boiled white,
 _O_ sparrow and arrow and hell below,
 _O_ , she says, because she loves to say _O_.
