# kino
## No‘u Revilla
your black inscriptions cite a kino lau,
whose feathered wingspan, nighttime eyes & pun-
ishing beak comprise mo‘okū‘auhau.
w/my oiled hands, I greet her, w/hun-

gering for mo‘opuna. “mai,” she says,
reciting from your thigh. “mai, mai e ‘ai.”
I have traveled from Maui a lizard, mes-
merized by dreams of ‘ōhi‘a & ai-

kāne, lizard filled w/smoke. arrived, I eat
transforming in the forest of your grand-
mother’s memory: from lizard: woman
dreaming: licking tattoo: permission land:

skin. traveling the night of your kino
to sleep your thighs, ho‘āo, ho‘āo, and wake.
