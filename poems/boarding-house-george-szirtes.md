# Boarding House
## George Szirtes
Dark corridors, crammed bedrooms, stairs that smell
of cigarette smoke and impermanence.
Long days of waiting. Ringing of the bell

that calls us to our dinner. Shillings and pence
that fill the hand. The wallpaper. The pulse
of other people’s half-heard arguments.

The landlord’s dog. Interminable phone calls
in the lobby. Someone is falling apart,
another’s longing to be somewhere else.

You hold on to the street map of your heart
and make yourself at home. You’re here at last,
whatever “here” now means. Now you can start

your childhood again, the world a mythic past
you’ll wander into by mistake, the joys
of lost performance with a vanished cast

of now-imagined names that other boys
might whisper just to put you in a spin.
It is another language that deploys

the tottering edifice that you live in.
Strangers will come and go, are gone for good.
The bedrooms empty. Here is a new skin

for you to wear in the enchanted wood.
