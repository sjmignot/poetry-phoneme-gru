# From "Semele"
## Elizabeth Campbell
There was terror already
in her love even before
she knew for sure her lover was the god.

Her forehead
skidded a little on the sweat
of his chest and close to his ear

Semele begged again for proof.
And it didnâ€™t feel like a myth or a metaphor to her
as she burned up with the brightness she saw.
