# down like a shot
## Aziza Barnes
falling into unearthed light or something like that is who I was last night.
you brought
me a drink you didn’t know the name of & told me I _could get it._ you
not the drink which I downed even though it was my 9th
of the night the drink not you. dancehall. always
dancehall. a manner of movement learned
& not easily lost so I wind my hips
anyway & something is happening
to you. _you bout to start_
 _some shit_ & I say _good_. not
because it would be.
I haven’t been
touched
in a while.
 _don’t start something you can’t finish_ is maybe the worst advice
I’ve ever heard as you drop a handful of my ass
thudding down a small flight of stairs.
that’s what I am. a small flight
of stairs, a small
flight, down.
