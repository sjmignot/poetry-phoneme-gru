# Necklaced Whalebone
## dg nanouk okpik
As I       toss & roll

these bones

at the 2nd,  3rd & 4th vertebra

the curvity of my neck

where something

of  a       winged   fused

bowed   & fossilized

merged   kink-bended

wrongly & fused  bowed

& fossilized    then merged

bended   slouched    in a

hunchbacked   crooked

pain    into   a pinged

pang    where   needles

& cracks at my side-to-side

forced   hanging   sluiced

movement   of   ivory

scalloped   cervixes  at the

nape   & snaps   snaps

I rebound   at the fear

& instinctively   quake

with vanquished surrender

in numbness   & wake  then

mumble   you’re part of me

now   leave   & it slaps its tale

then    a V formation following

& decelerates   the sea waved

source   of   vigor  110  years old.
