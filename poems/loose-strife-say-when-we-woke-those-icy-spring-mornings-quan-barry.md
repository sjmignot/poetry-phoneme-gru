# loose strife [Say, when we woke those icy spring mornings]
## Quan Barry
Say, when we woke those icy spring mornings they were still there.
The upper portion of their faces long ruined but you could still see
                                        the meaning in their hands,

palms once covered in gold. We knew better than to call them
by their names, Light that Shines Throughout the Universe
                         and His consort, but there were stories

of  travelers lost  in the foothills of  the Hindu  Kush and a distant
brilliance that led them home. The way a candle physically enters
                                        your body after it has been

snuffed out. The pearly smoke suffused in the air. In one school
hundreds  of  miles  away  all  the   girls  my age  were  poisoned,
                              and last week outside the capital

a woman like my  sister was shot dead  in front of a crowd by two men
who forced their bodies into her body and then judged her an infidel
                                        so they could kill her

and be done with it.  After the  visitors were blasted I had a dream.
I saw a human man standing by a lake and no one was looking at him
                                          directly. His image

on the surface of the water cleaner than anything in this world.
In   my   dream  the  man   said,  “Thousands   of  lifetimes  ago
                                        when my body was cut

into pieces by an evil king, I was not caught up in the idea of the self.”
Then  in  my   dream  someone   picked  up  a rock  and  I  woke  up.
                              It took almost a month,

the  great  heads  drilled with holes,  then anti-aircraft  tanks rolled in.
Each hundred-foot niche now empty but each cavity left shaped like us,
                              like a person. Before it happened

we talked about it. Grandfather said don’t they have a share in heaven?
Second Aunt said it was more realistic this way. God not in heaven
                                        but in exile.
