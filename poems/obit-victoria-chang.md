Caretakers — died in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, one
after another. One didn’t show up because her husband was in prison. Most
others watched the clock. Time breaks for the living eventually and they can
walk out of doors. The handle of time’s door is hot for the dying. What use is
a door if you can’t exit? A door that can’t be opened is called a wall. My
father is on the other side of the wall. Tomatoes are ripening on the other
side. I can see them through the window that also can’t be opened. A window
that can’t be opened is just a see-through wall. Sometimes we’re on the inside
like a plane. Most of the time, we’re on the outside like doggie day care. I
don’t know if the tomatoes are the new form of his language or if they’re
simply for eating. I can’t ask him  because on the other side, there are no
words. All I can do is stare at the nameless bursting tomatoes and know they
have to be enough.
