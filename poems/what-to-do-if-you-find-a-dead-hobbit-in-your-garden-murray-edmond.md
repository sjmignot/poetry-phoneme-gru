# What to Do If You Find a Dead Hobbit in Your Garden
## Murray Edmond
• Phone your local police station. They have a 24-hour answering service.
Please note your message will be used for training purposes. Your voice print
will be added to their database.

• Access Hobbit Rescue (HR) on the Hobbit Rescue app (type in Hobbit Rescue).
Type your address in the required box. Wait for assistance to arrive.

• Do not touch the Hobbit. Warner Bros. can recycle most parts of a Hobbit.
Interference with any part of a dead Hobbit is a crime. Remember: you will be
liable!

• Do not Facebook your Friends. Some of your Friends may not be Friends.
Australian Unionists are known Trollers. Be vigilant. Unionists have no part
in our film industry.

• When Hobbit Rescue arrives they will ask you questions. You are required to
answer. Hobbits are an integral platform in our  national economy. Withholding
information from a private company in pursuit of its legitimate profit can be
deemed a treasonable act.

• Remember Hobbits are our friends. They were born here. This is their home.
They represent our way of life. Do you want to lose that way of life?
