# You'd Think the Sky Would Run Out of Water
## Todd Colby
You'd think the sky would run out of water,
but it won't; it just keeps coming down. I need someone
to marvel at the breath escaping from me.
Do you have a natural resource you prefer to exploit?
Does someone think of you and turn the channel?
How would you ever know?
Have you ever zoned out during _Downton Abbey_?
I'm certain of something I'd prefer not to tell you about.
"Slow down," you say. But I can already see my breath,
and its only October. Walking with you is making everything
watery and spazzed out, like a movie about sex
where I have sex and people are all like,
"He's amazing, we really like his sex style!"
But I digress. Will you please stand up when called upon to tell
the audience how wonderful I was in my best moments;
like someone in senior management delegating things and being sure
of everything but how to stop? I promise I'll make this up to
you. I'll write your name on the menu board,
and people will come into the store all expectant of you.
