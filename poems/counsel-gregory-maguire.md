## Gregory Maguire
But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
A strategy of continence, avoidance, mule-headedness, and hope.

The next assassin, brush fire, or virus swerves this way, head-on collision;
We see it coming and can’t divert — the path too crowded with pilgrims.

By the side of the road to Calvary blooms a mustard bush.
It never means to do anything but propagate.

It sees the centuries winnow themselves in and out,
And hears itself appropriated for a parable.

It keeps all these things, and ponders them in its heart
While casting savior seeds generation after generation.
