    But what if all suffering is in fact for nothing—
no particular wisdom after, blooming flower-like,
blood in the water? To be sttripped of one’s armor
and left naked, dying, on a field of war—that’s what
humiliation meant, once. Remember? There’s a color
I’ve seen, sometimes, just before some larger mistake
happens that will chage everything, and forever,
soon a life will turn—even now, begins to... Mercy’s
a cliff, I think; a sea adorns it; if I forget the name, if
I forget what I called the sea—here, beneath the several
whips of the smoke tree’s twisted branches—what’s
it matter? How at bay the light seems. For once, let’s
be still. Together. It could be hunger, it could be sex,
that smell, or fearfulness, or just fear by itself—tenderer
hands than ours, soundlessly, as they at least unyoke us.
