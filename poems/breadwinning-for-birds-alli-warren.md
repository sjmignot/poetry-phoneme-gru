# Breadwinning for Birds
## Alli Warren
They pay me to lift
the ball off the bat
touch the slender hand
and slip beneath the taut band

I plant bulbs and mulch the mound
I hone a group of black birds
I do the simplest thing

In unison with the trees
people move as the sun moves
He calls a seagull an eagle
and I agree

Across the pond
they say I _will_
I know this is a problem
for the painter, etc.

Tell me where to go
if they ditch me mid-season
tell me a word
seeks its world

Praise be to the upper lip of decision
praise be to dumb clanking stems

Everything is alive
even you, floral loafer
