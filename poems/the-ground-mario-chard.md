# The Ground
## Mario Chard
_Say they still_
 _tie ropes to the caskets
_
of immigrants they find

in the desert. That a rope
saves time should
someone come looking.

Say it was a man.
It was. There is
a boy mowing

the cemetery lawn.
He is perfect
at cutting close.

 _Go in_. How will I know
when it’s close?
The ground

unpacked above his box
remade the box
above the ground.

 _Sit down_. Say he sat down.
Where? It matters
that they sat so close.

How many? Fourteen.
 _Make room_. The mower
stops to move a vase.

The sweetest dream
that labor knows. His space
marked at the gate —

unknown male.
What could he do
in the van without space?

Say he was sleeping.
Did he dream? Yes.
And after the crash?

Died in the dream.
 _Inside_. Or woke
in the sand. The brush.

The ground was his dream.
Legs pulled up in a van
dream of ground.

Under now. Wake up,
the mower says.
He has stopped

where I lie. His face.
You have aged, I say.
 _Wake up_.

I am looking up.
Will you still age?
His face is changed.
