# Thirty Going
## Natalie Shapero
on seventeen, I come from hearty straw.
My grandpa wore a gallon
hat. My grandma, like a shogun,
bun and shawl. For their honeymoon,
they went to the movies. No one
knows what they saw.

You arrive with licorice, cigarettes,
the documentary on Woody Allen.
Donâ€™t feign a passion for his start

in tv, or his clarinets,
or _Love and Death_. Just skip to the Soon-
Yi part.
