# Chicago: A Historical & Literary Review
## Randall Horton
        chicago: city of ice-cold wind — elbow city of the rectangular block,
where bigger thomas choked mary dalton in a drunken stupor on cottage grove,
that great avenue divider between the haves & have-nots, where my uncle sydney
fled after escaping an alabama chain gang a quarter after midnight &,
consequently, cleaved the tennessee river (shackles & all) into another state
of freedom. chicago: home of the case pocketknife, the nickel-plated snub
nose, the banana-suit wearer, gold tooth & all. they migrated from alabama red
dirt, from arkansas cotton fields bowlegged & pigeon-toed, & if you’ve ever
resided on the west side, then you might as well been living in lil’
mississippi: natchez, vicksburg, grenada, yazoo city, booneville. chicago:
home of the winding el, the circling loop, the midnight cruise down lake shore
from hyde park straight to buddy guy’s  legends; all them blues in one locale.
the one-night stands the city gives you — the identity it injects then sucks
from your marrow; the lives gunned down. chicago: where gwendolyn brooks
scribed _In the Mecca_ featuring  pepita, our tragic protagonist: assaulted,
murdered  & forgotten by blue lives matter in ’68 & today nothing has changed.
chicago: come sit in the corrupted light.
