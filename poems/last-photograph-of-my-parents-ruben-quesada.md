San Jose, Costa Rica
Tortillas clap against floured palms,
steaming bowls of avena, frijoles
black as the rumbling sky,
 _arroz con pollo_ simmers. Against the kitchen

window, small clouds rise. Papá dances
to the electric beat of the marimba,
his cheek bristly against Mamá’s
neck; his thick fingers sift

through her wispy hair. I am nowhere
to be found, neither in the foreground nor
background. Today I sit in this chair,
in the corner of my house, covered
with a poncho of blue flowers,
looking out at asphalt roads overflowing
with rain, fogging the glass. Along the road,
steam rises like blotchy fingerprints.
