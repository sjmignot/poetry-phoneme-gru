# Sir Say Pray
## Amy Beeder
After Thomas Hardy
The milkmaids say _Pray_ for their speech is reserved,
fixed here in circles of opalized light.

Presenting themselves without fancy or choice
chapped hands on the full udder’s verge,

y’know — cream-skinned, gathering toad spume on skirts
relentlessly cracking the snails underfoot —

a century later & more their compeers bow heads
to these luminous fields made of ether,

of blue & extravagant air, calling up with the same
nimble fingers their ciphered familiars,

girl-souls at large in a nonhuman hour.
Speaking their argot & screen-practiced moue.

Not to _you_ , with your paper, your man-heavy shoes,
untouched by the mulch of the digital yard!

They only gaze rapt at threshold, milk spilled.
No purchase for you here, _Sir_ , & no clue —
