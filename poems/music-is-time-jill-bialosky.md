# Music Is Time
## Jill Bialosky
_Music is time,_ said the violin master.
You can’t miss the stop or you’ll miss the train.
_One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,
_
one, two, three, four.

She clapped her hands together
as the boy moved the bow across the strings.
_One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,
_
one, two, three, four, the violin master shouted,

louder and more shrill so that her voice
traveled through the house like a metronome,
guiding him, commanding him to translate the beat,
to trust his own internal rhythm.

 _Good boy,_ she said.
_See how hard you have to be on yourself?
_
How will your violin know who you are
unless you make it speak?
