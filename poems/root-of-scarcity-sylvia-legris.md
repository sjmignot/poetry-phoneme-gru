# Root of Scarcity
## Sylvia Legris
To sow the remote morose root.
To sow the virtuous standby.
The backup fodder-crop suffers not
from seasonal vicissitudes,
mildew and blast, caterpillar attack.

Under Saturn sing the golden-sickled beet.
Under Saturn sing the ringed mangelwurzel.
The great turnip (the dick reuben!).
The pickled paucity-strick stew.
