# Youth
## David Steingass
I vowed I'd quit ciggies on the heel of the mother
Of all hangovers. The world at noon pulsed a first

Columbus Ohio spring day. I'd fallen in love
Of course, as recently as chem lab and held

The ghost of her smell
In my clothes. Or lips

If I'd been lucky. My blood _thunk_
 _Thunk-thunked_ , the way a cut feels

As you bend to tie shoes. The way life
Tingles the first day it breaks loose

To crawl your skin. Dizzy,
I ran through milky sap and

Sycamore-leafed streets, mixing the smells
Of just-thawed earth with essence of girl

My blood steamed. I understood lost-at-sea as glamorous
Isolation, the way a hummingbird's movement through two

Eye blinks allows it to vanish and
Re-appear. My wings blurred hinges

Among worlds. Nothing held me. Nothing
Could catch me. I'd run this way forever.
