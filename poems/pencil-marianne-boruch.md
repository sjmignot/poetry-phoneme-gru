# Pencil
## Marianne Boruch
My drawing teacher said: _Look_ , _think_ , _make a mark_.
Look, I told myself.
And waited to be marked.

Clouds are white but they darken
with rain. Even a child blurs them back
to little woolies on a hillside, little
bundles without legs. Look, my teacher
would surely tell me, they’re nothing

like that. _Like_ that: the lie. _Like_ that: the poem.
She said: Respond to the heaviest part
of the figure first. Density is
form. That I keep hearing _destiny_

is not a mark of character. Like _pilgrimage_
once morphed to _mirage_ in a noisy room, someone
so earnest at my ear. Then _marriage_ slid.
 _Mir-aage_ , _Mir-aage_ , I heard the famous poet let loose
awry into her microphone, triumphant.

The figure to be drawn —
not even half my age. She’s completely
emptied her face for this job of standing still an hour.
_Look_. Okay. But the little

dream in there, inside the _think_
that comes next. A pencil in my hand, its secret life
is charcoal, the wood already burnt,
a sacrifice.
