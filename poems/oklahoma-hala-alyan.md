For a place I hate, I invoke you often. Stockholm’s: I am eight years old and
the telephone poles are down, the power plant at the edge of town spitting
electricity. Before the pickup trucks, the strip malls, dirt beaten by
Cherokee feet. _Osiyo, tsilugi_. Rope swung from mule to tent to man,
tornadoes came, the wind rearranged the face of the land like a chessboard.
This was before the gold rush, the greed of engines, before white men pressing
against brown women, nailing crosses by the river, before the slow songs of
cotton plantations, the hymns toward God, the murdered dangling like earrings.
Under a redwood, two men signed away the land and in history class I don’t
understand why a boy whispers _sand monkey_. The Mexican girls let me sit with
them as long as I braid their hair, my fingers dipping into that wet black
silk. I try to imitate them at home —  _mírame, mama_  — but my mother yells
at me, says they didn’t come here so I could speak some beggar language.
Heaven is a long weekend. Heaven is a tornado  siren canceling school. Heaven
is pressed in a pleather booth at the Olive Garden, sipping Pepsi between my
gapped teeth, listening to my father mispronounce his meal.
