# The Friend
## John Maucere
The Friend wriggled out and stood, a smiling tree, his shimmering head turning
left and right. A person came along and looked up and said, “Who are you?” The
Friend said, “Come on, get a buzz. It’s awesome!” The person said, “I don’t
need that,” and walked off. “Wait!” The Friend caught up and tickled him, his
fingers hooking him and reeling him in. The Friend promised he would be
popular. The person said, “Really?” He wasn’t convinced. The Friend poured it
on, slathering him until he reeled. The Friend slathered and slathered until
his head bubbled. Reeling in circles, he fell down. “Hey!” The Friend tried to
wake him up. “Oh no! He’s dead!” He scooped up dirt, dropped the person in,
and patted it down. He acted as if nothing had happened. Then came along
another person. The Friend perked up and waved.
