# Please, Not That Again
## William Trowbridge
How burdensome they seemed, wartime
oldies that could drive our parents teary:

“I’ll Be Seeing You,” with its hint
of being swept off in a global riptide;

or the shaky follow-up of “I’ll Be Home
for Christmas,” followed by a shakier

“Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree
(with Anyone Else But Me),” “Comin’

in on a Wing and a Prayer,” or “Ac-
Cent-Tchu-Are the Positive.” We suffered

them on the old cathedral radio, crooned
by Crosby and Sinatra, had to watch them

strangled on _The Lawrence Welk Show_
or laced with Como’s heavy dose

of sedative. Dad told us, “Straighten Up
and Fly Right.” Mom hummed, “Keep

the Home Fires Burning”—till our music
cut the cord. Brash and free of corn,

it hailed rock ‘n’ roll, caught Maybellene
at the top of the hill, moaned “m’ baby-doll,

m’ baby-doll, m’ baby-doll.” We played it
loud and often, but they never understood.
