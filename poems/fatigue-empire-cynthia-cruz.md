# Fatigue Empire
## Cynthia Cruz
Food in the underworld, the Death
King

In his seedy, green nightgown
Holding up flowers.

The warden of the underworld
In her plastic, pink

Wheelchair
Serving silver trays of

Shit and death and black
Gelatinous.

Birth, the music
Reminds me and

Will not stop
When I turn it off,

A warped music box
 _Trapped inside._

I repeat what I cannot bear:
Chronic repetition.

This poem is its own
Language.

It marks the mind
Like a missing memory

Marks the body. Then it
Changes, makes it invisible.

Back form the edge of what
Becomes.
