''At one time, I dreaded everything I was making.'
Yayoi Kusama (Winter 1999)
First it is just a measling of the tablecloth
but soon it spills
in all colours, all gaiety:
                           desk        floor        lamp        flowers
          tatami, my underwear

then dares to paw across
         Mother’s face, so
smilingdelirious.

Twenty years
in a twelve square metre room
with the thuds of tennis balls
the only music

tells me
that suffering
is necessary

and more powerful
than healing

and I wish
to cover all territory
for once—hospital beds, chinaware,
bed linen, your bland skin

with the pattern and fear of all my dots—
by the old wharf on Naoshima
I make my yellow wartime pumpkins.

I know my home is not a country anymore,
just a festering colony of the mind:

these shuddering trees
that come and talk to me each night,
the whispers of the white nurses
and the star-dances
of my Japanese kaleidoscope.
Come haunt me still. Do what you may.
I won’t return. I’m not afraid.
