# Walking, Blues
## Jane Mead
Rain so dark I
can’t get through—
train going by

in a hurry. The voice
said _walk or die_ , I
walked,—the train

and the voice all
blurry. I walked with
my bones and my heart

of chalk, not even
a splintered notion:
days of thought, nights

of worry,—lonesome
train in a hurry.
