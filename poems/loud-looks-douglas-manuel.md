# Loud Looks
## Douglas Manuel
_You better rap,_ my brother
says—he can
b-box his ass off.
Got DJ scratches and spins,

will drop it on the two
and four, the three and four.
Whatever you need.

Me posing my bars: _My flows_
 _are second to none, come here,_
 _son. See how it’s done._

Wanted to be a rapper? Check.
Thought I was going to the NBA? Check.
Father went to prison? Check.
Brother too? Check.
Mother died when I was eight? Check.
Hung pictures of Luke Perry
on my bedroom wall?

 _What?_

Yep, give me a bit, and I’ll sprinkle
some subjectivity on it.

I loved that dude, his whisper-voice, his lean.
Auntie worried on the phone:
 _Girl, he got photos of some white boy_
 _all over his walls._ Me rocking out
to Tom Petty’s “You Don’t Know How It Feels.”

Silent head nods do more
than throw shade.

 _All black people are fluent_

 _in silence._ Mangled Baldwin quote?
Let’s keep wrenching. Everybody’s

fluent in silence.

You know what
a switchblade glare means. No need
to read the look she gave me

as I sang, _Let me run_
 _with you tonight._
