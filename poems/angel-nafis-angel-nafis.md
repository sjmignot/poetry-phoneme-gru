Angel, most loyal blood. Keep-a-promise,
grow-an-imperfect-garden-blood.

goddamn know-it-all hand-me-down.

Angel don’t touch me here or there or there.
Can you smell me? Angel unspooled yards

of fabric. Yards and yards of unusable fabric.
Everything has hands, a mouth, everything reaches
across time and tissue.

 _The ovaries were kissing
_
The ovaries were not identified at the initial point
of the procedure, but after extensive lysis
they were revealed and noted The left fallopian
tube significantly dilated and tortuous

the pelvic sidewall

 _After obtaining informed consent the patient was taken
_
to the operating room She had been placed on foam pads
to prevent slippage while in the Trendelenburg position
Arms tucked at her sides Legs supported in Yellofins stirrups
The cervix grasped with a single-tooth

Angel obliterated melon.
Fastened to a dark star.
Lacerated like a web.
Tender witch, misunderstood
by the tide’s swift grip.
Ms. Nafis mortal as a rose.
Nobody’s mama.
