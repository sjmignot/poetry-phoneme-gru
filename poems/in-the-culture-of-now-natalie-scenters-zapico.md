# In the Culture of Now
## Natalie Scenters-Zapico
My mother is dying of too much electricity on the brain, my father, a limp in
his walk, _&_ my macho lost his green card at a bus station. I want words
split letter for letter to turn sound into wisdom on my losses.

•

My macho says: _Your skin is the color of milk, you glow between sheets_. ¿Who
gives more light: me, or the luna lunera? Too much milk makes you sick —
drink, drink, cascabelera.

•

I want to leave my hembra behind. ¿What are my options? She bleeds on the rug,
births a litter, then hides limp bodies in kitchen cabinets.

•

I lied. My father is dying of too much electricity on the brain, my macho, a
limp in his walk, _&_ my mother lost her green card at a bus station. Who
these losses happened to matter to no one but me. To others, my loss is only
worth its sum parts.

•

I pour a shot to get the flies drunk. Watch their little legs stagger. I like
the flies tipsy, like my macho likes me when I am glazed on the kitchen floor,
begging him not to leave me.

•

Come kill me over the stove, under the running shower head, gravel my skin
bloody. I am so afraid one night my macho will choke me to death, though I am
not afraid of dying.

•

My macho says: _Hembra, I imagine the woman I love when I’m with you, but
you’re not that woman_. I ask: _Who is she?_ My macho says: _Cállate, take off
your dress_. Each of   his fingers strokes death. I only want to die. So I
die, una y otra vez.
