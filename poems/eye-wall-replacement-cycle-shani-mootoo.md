# eye wall replacement cycle
## Shani Mootoo
the sleep that restores
weakens to strengthen
to rattle first
cocos nucifera ...

yes, cocos nucifera, consort of a lesser wind
cocos nucifera’s trunk bends and sings
coquettish, it curtsies and flirts

... yet in a cat 5 assault
its branches are ripped out like feathers ...
one by one, half the treetop
decapitated, gone

(the tree rat lives in the coconut tree
at night it scurries inside
thuds upon the kitchen counter and awakens you

in a hurricane it is but a downy feather
before an electric fan
on a hot and humid afternoon)
