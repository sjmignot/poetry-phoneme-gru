# the drone
## Clint Smith
the drone was once a scrap of metal     the drone looks as if it might be a
toy     the drone is not a toy     the drone could have been something other
than a killing machine     the drone could have been a house      the drone
could have been a spoon     the drone could have been a swing     the drone
does not know who it is going to kill next     the drone is going to kill next
the drone has learned to disguise itself as a shard of sky     the drone’s
soft hum is a disembodied echo    the drone was mistaken for a star once
the drone renders itself celestial     the drone scoffs at sovereignty     the
drone asks _what is a border if you can fly right over it?_ the drone was
built by a man     the drone killed a man      & a woman     & a child     the
drone killed a child     & did not see her face     the drone does not see a
face     the drone sees a body     & then the body is gone.
