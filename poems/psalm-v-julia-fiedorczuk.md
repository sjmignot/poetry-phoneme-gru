# Psalm V
## Julia Fiedorczuk
Beauty exists, _la ermozura egziste_ and paradises
are not artificial, yet how can one have fans
of ginkgo, green right next to yellow, and human
faces in the sunshine, pearls of architecture and thoughts
about the dust that we become? Two days later
I remember only theory, what we said concerning
the mathematics of the Alhambra and the fragments
of poems, so I undress quickly, to catch life
red-handed, to relish the goodness
of your home amid the hills encircled
by a wedding party where I seek and find, seek
and do not find, seek and disappear and —
