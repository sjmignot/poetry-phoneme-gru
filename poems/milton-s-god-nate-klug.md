Where i-95 meets the Pike,
a ponderous thunderhead flowered;

stewed a minute, then flipped
like a flash card, tattered
edges crinkling in, linings so _dark
_
with excessive bright

that, standing, waiting, at the overpass edge,
the onlooker couldnâ€™t decide

until the end, or even then,
what was revealed and what had been hidden.
