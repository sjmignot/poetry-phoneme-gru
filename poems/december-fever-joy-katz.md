# December, Fever
## Joy Katz
A tang approaches, like the smell of snow.
Illness like a color deepens—
pale gray, thick-in-a-cloak gray, secret coat silk,
and finally the weight of rough pelts heaped on the bed.

The last enchantment of the day is tearing pages out of a book.
The paper soft and thin, like falling asleep
(a hand backstage smoothing my hair:
the school friend, Lakamp, became an undertaker)

My baby laughs to rip the pages.
Stays by me, does this damage.
The tearing moves like voltage through my own hands.

 _Oh mother skimming fever_

I need him to linger

 _are you still happening there, in your body?_

I just want to lie at the edge of breaking.

Yes, I am still backstage, here in my body.
The baby pulls out another page—
leaving him would come this easily.

I will bind myself to the thinnest sounds,
the feather coming out of the pillow.

Please keep ripping up the words.
Please don’t need anything from me.
