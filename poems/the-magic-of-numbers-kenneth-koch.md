_The Magic of Numbers—1_

How strange it was to hear the furniture being moved around in the apartment
upstairs!
I was twenty-six, and you were twenty-two.


 _The Magic of Numbers—2_

You asked me if I wanted to run, but I said no and walked on.
I was nineteen, and you were seven.


 _The Magic of Numbers—3_

Yes, but does X really like us?
We were both twenty-seven.


 _The Magic of Numbers—4_

You look like Jerry Lewis (1950).


 _The Magic of Numbers—5_

Grandfather and grandmother want you to go over to their house for dinner.
They were sixty-nine, and I was two and a half.


 _The Magic of Numbers—6_

One day when I was twenty-nine years old I met you and nothing happened.


 _The Magic of Numbers—7_

No, of course it wasn’t I who came to the library!
Brown eyes, flushed cheeks, brown hair. I was twenty-nine, and you were
sixteen.


 _The Magic of Numbers—8_

After we made love one night in Rockport I went outside and kissed the road
I felt so carried away. I was twenty-three, and you were nineteen.


 _The Magic of Numbers—9_

I was twenty-nine, and so were you. We had a very passionate time.
Everything I read turned into a story about you and me, and everything I did
was turned into a poem.
