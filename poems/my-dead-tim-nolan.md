# My Dead
## Tim Nolan
They grow in number all the time
The cat, the Mother, the Father
The grandparents, aunts, and uncles

Those I knew well and hardly at all
My best friend from when I was ten
The guy who sat with me in the back

Of the class where the tall kids lived
 _Bill the Shoemaker_ from Lyndale Avenue
The Irish poet with rounded handwriting

They live in _The Land of Echo, The Land_
 _Of Reverb_ , and I hear them between
The notes of the birds, the _plash_ of the wave

On the smooth rocks. They show up
When I think of them, as if they always
Are waiting for me to remember

I drive by their empty houses
I put on their old sweaters and caps
I wear their wristwatches and spend

Their money. So now I'm in six places
At onceâ€”if not eighteen or twenty
So many places to be thinking of them

Strange how quiet they are with their presence
So humble in the low song they sing
Not expecting that anyone will listen
