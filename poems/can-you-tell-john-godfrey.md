# Can You Tell
## John Godfrey
Happens this time
in answer to indecency
Lit by the yellow
shop windows cast
Unkind to you, that light
You say, Sit, Ubu, sit, or
Hey, I like your weave

This avenue for instance
Gateway to escapade
You can see from the
beginning to its end
All-embracing greed
Distracting appliqu√©s
of altruism
Small pomme de terre
Can you tell whose
hand on the basinet
and that does what for you

Warmth all in the light
Sight all in
garage park hallway
Morning's dusk on pause
You stand body in profile
What you don't fill
in the doorway stays empty
More than overcome
I know you're there
and unseal my lips
