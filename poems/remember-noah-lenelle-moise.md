# remember noah
## Lenelle Mo√Øse
you have to understand
it was so hot

sand as far as the eye could see
sand in teeth

a sealess life
every step a sinking a scratch

every storm
more sand

no sweat when we danced
pure salt in our lovemaking

i tried to spit once
it came out like a whistle

my first period
curry powder

old wives
spoke of tears

we thought they were
senile

laughter was
our wettest thing

we prayed often
to no one

we believed
in music

dry palms clapping
dust on ankle bracelets

we threw tabla and daff
caught spirit and sagat

a blaring life
the wailing or caesarean births

widows' eyes
wept wind

even our tongues were
tanned

something sun-dried
in every recipe

rays
were babies' first words

you have to understand
we forgot how to be thirsty

mud by then
was primitive

splashing
the stuff of legend

only giddiness
quenched us

we were dizzy all the time
in the world all the time

then we heard him
grumbling to himself

something about forty
something about a flood

clad in sheep's wool
he reeked of wolf shit

something about monogamy
something about shelter

i thought:
this must be heatstroke

i thought:
the brain of a six-hundred-year-old

i thought:
he is a conceptual artist

the ark
an installation

his masterpiece
took years

took trees
got bigger

he was our favorite
dirty joke

beloved schizophrenic
neighbor

then he started preaching
then he kidnapped pigs

mosquitos
doves

things that wanted to eat each other
stuffed onto the same boat

we threw our heads back
we slapped ashy knees

we mooned him
threw hot stones

we streaked
whistled in his face

kicked the baking
ship

laughter was
our thunder thing

the lucky ones died
laughing

for centuries
he warned us

condescending motherfucker
foaming at the mouth

sweat dripping
from his beard

condensation
how did we miss it?

i have no words for the first drop
cooling the cheek

grandfathers raised their arms
lightning made the children leap

sizzle gave way to drizzle
humidity taught humility

we opened our mouths
swallowing everything

the clouds begat clouds
began to bite us back
 ****
panic soaked
our slouching spines

the instruments
drowned first

we played them sopping
out of tune

denial gave way
to rivers

i fell into a puddle
my very first shiver

the shock of cold water
made me orgasm

so all the times before
had been dry heave?

so this was mourning
this was mikveh?

the sky from blue
to za'atar hail

we choked
god's vomit filled our lungs

apologies bellyflopped
reaching went out of reach

we ran from high desert
to highest mountain

to whirlpool
or choral grief

if noah had keen merciful
he would have taught us how to swim

instead he saved
two mice

muttered prayers
shut the door

the best belly dancers
became mermaids

the dinosaurs learned
to fly

we never saw
a rainbow

our grave stones
coral reef
