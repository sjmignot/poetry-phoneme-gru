# Departures: Chapter One
## Lisa Russ Spaar
Morning’s mirage, disdainful _&_ calm
          as a mirror,

held the shorn bush that yesterday
          flourished,

now lopped canes _&_ a scant spitfall
          of remnance,

confetti trampled in the clefts
          of vanishing deer.

To touch its truth I punched my fist
          into the chopped molest,

the boscage—withdrew my red sleeve.
          Abstract that.
