# From "Empty Words"
## Zaffar Kunial
Meaning “homeland” —  _mulk_
(in Kashmir) — exactly how
my son demands milk.


•



Full-rhyme with  _Jhelum_ ,
the river nearest his home —
my father’s “realm.”

•



You can’t put a leaf
between _written_ and _oral_ ;
that first _A_ , or _alif_.

•



Letters. West to east
Mum’s hand would write; Dad’s script goes
east to west. Received.

•



Invader, to some —
neither here, nor there, with me —
our rhododendron.

•



Where migrating geese
pause to sleep — somewhere, halfway
is this pillow’s crease.

•



Now we separate
for the first time, on our walk,
at the kissing gate.

•



Old English “Deor” —
an exile’s lament, the past’s
dark, half-opened door.

•



Yes, I know. _Empty_.
But there’s just something between
the _p_ and the _t_.

•



At home in Grasmere —
thin mountain paths have me back,
a boy in Kashmir.
