## Saaro Umar
the archivist         enters the room
with a    bag of oranges

she
broke one on                 the walk over
her shirt tucked        under bra          strings
of     juice
draw down         her chin


he
is sitting at the         table when  she enters
facing the     open window     that
exits  to
a     skyline
licked with     fog        a thick cover    of


buildings    hang       from the clouds


she hasn’t yet          learnt
to              know words &
not their          meaning

camera
spills
through the         gaps in her teeth
lands       within the    hollow
that     turns to      plump
breast;
meeting place

her father walks      to the kitchen sink
empties the steaming        jug into   terra-cotta bowl
steeps      the dried khat
until it   turns         to tea


they say the leaf of God
conjures        old ghosts
but  he weathers     the nightmares
for      the         memories

the children
marching     in     twos past
where  he     stood cutting    leaf & cane


the  eldest      of twelve
first       from his      village to
enter   university
swallowed       the language
of    three       colonizers

afaan  oromo he
kept
hidden in the    secret of his cheeks


she    thought
everything     unknowable    stayed
hallowed    in    transit

the crackle of      scalded onions
  &      oil
her     aunty covered    in gold  & satin
towering   over    gleaming    blue
hands     filled
with      wood   &    metal


as   the      doctor
eased    her     knees open
back       pressed against
white   linen
imitation      cotton
forced  against      her  meat

she     found
etched         onto
ceiling

two      mountains
estranged by
migrant ash       white
like the      dripped
seed    of the poplar   in spring
clotted       between the
blackened                   roots
of      Odaa     Nabee
the sound       of thunder
kindling           the    floodplain;
meeting place


he takes        his seat
at the    table
an old      study desk from
the salvos     reads like an atlas


scrunches a    piece of green
places it     in his mouth

rests his hands at     the end of the counter
&
asks

where is your country?

she   draws her
finger      to the
    middle    of her chest
etching     circles onto
skin

her tongue   loops
the enclave of    her cheeks

drawing    rings
across flesh   then    slips
past the white    threads
that     drip from teeth

she gestures to the      back of her
mouth      her left palm remains
on  breast

&  says
in   here
