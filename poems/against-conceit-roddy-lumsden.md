# Against Conceit
## Roddy Lumsden
Don't say _Sir Pigeon in his cobalt bonnet_.
Don't find among your notes
jottings on duvets and blizzards and the page

unwalked across                _black missives of girlhood_
must be sent off and do not claim the furnace
of the universe is powered by human screams.

When the dark turns dark
or when the bullet lifts a scalp,
it is enough to know the lover feels the slap

that the world can hear the sharp shout
               which wakes the cat
her claws one inch from the rabbit's bobbing scut.
