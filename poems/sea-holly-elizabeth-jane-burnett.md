in the clay in the loam in the top of  the soil
in the sand in the molt of  the sea

in the light sand the light sound of shift in the swash
zone waves burrow for release

in the bend of  the body
I balance my current only takes me back
when seawards seawards is the call of my curve
& no turning

Two large cormorants flew rapidly and very low across the water heading
directly towards Langstone Rock, where Dawlish Warren joins the coast just
beyond the western edge of the Exe estuary. Their wing tips were almost
touching the choppy water. This must have been about 7:45 on Friday morning; I
was thirty yards or so out in the sea, only my head visible between the waves
that the cormorants flew in among as they powered along one behind the other.
I had come down the concrete lifeboat ramp and taken just a few steps on wet
sand scattered with various shells, little gleaming stones, and scraps of
seaweed, getting quickly into the cool water. The sky was piled up with dark
gray cloud overhead but clear and bright at the horizon. The two birds passed
close by and continued on their way indifferent to me watching them from the
water and they gave no indication if they saw anything unusual.

And swimming my slow breast stroke out to the channel I saw a darkwinged
butterfly come flying in above the waves, moving with the breeze, heading for
the dunes. Was this a migrant painted lady, third generation, from Africa?
