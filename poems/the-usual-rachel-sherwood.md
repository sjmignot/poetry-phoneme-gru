# The Usual
## Rachel Sherwood
This is what it's like:
you sit in the white room
singular, knees together
arms over your head
to break the noise from the radio
that is false as a drunk's promise
to loan you his car next week.

Of course next week never comes
lies continue, nobody disbelieves them
but some are ready for the real story
the young man involved breaks her tired heart
it's the usual: spilt liquor,
broken dishes, wrecked cars.
