# Crow Song
## Margaret Atwood
### 1974

In the arid sun, over the field
where the corn has rotted and then
dried up, you flock and squabble.
not much here for you, my people,
but there would be
if
if

In my austere black uniform
I raised the banner
which decreed Hope
and which did not succeed
and which is not allowed.
Now I must confront the angel
who says Win,
who tells me to wave any banner
that you will follow

for you ignore me, my
baffled people, you have been through
too many theories
too many stray bullets
your eyes are gravel, skeptical,

in this hard field 
you pay attention only
to the rhetoric of seed
fruit stomach elbow.

You have too many leaders
you have too many wars,
all of them pompous and small,
you resist only when you feel
like dressing up,
you forget the sane corpses…
I know you would like a god
to come down and feed you
and punish you. That overcoat
on sticks is not alive
		 	there are no angels
but the angels of hunger,
prehensile and soft as gullets
			     Watching you
my people, I become cynical,
you have defrauded me of hope
and left me alone with politics …
