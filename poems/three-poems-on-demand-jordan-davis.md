No wonder they move so slowly—
Somebody in there is
Trying to write.

PICTURES OF BUGS BUNNY DRESSED LIKE A THUG

What drove me to draw this picture
Of Bugs Bunny dressed like a thug?

Plural. Pictures. Not once did I sketch
The buff tattooed torso of Thug Bugs

But many times, over several days.
He looks mean, doesn’t he? When O when

Will this election be over
So I can blow off life again

Without inadvertently producing objects
Of great and mysterious-to-me beauty.


 **POEM FOR A SIXTH WEDDING**

You know a lot better than I do
What you’re doing
