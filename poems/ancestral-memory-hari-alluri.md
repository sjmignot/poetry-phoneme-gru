# Ancestral Memory
## Hari Alluri
After Kwame Dawes
i

When the coming of another grave
jabs at me like harvest, stolen. And the flame
inside consumes. The uneasy hand of the sun
approaching. What was, given back by night.
When a body ascends away from reason,
a name is a form of oblation. Like ash, like loss
to the goddess of lost things, I fear
the belonging that ranks. I’m sorry,
I have held the few smooth lines I come from
in the way of a rooster, talon tied to blade.

Yes, belonging is a lie I tell
like any official crowd, something to hem
restlessness. A sock’s taut elastic waiting
for the day it goes to sag: trouble
in my own bones for a short flat time.
The digging I need in storm. This glory of tears,
I bind my pain, my labor to something else.

For those days you pocket-dial your cousin,
kapwatid long since drowned. For those moments
when feathers of your hope
are a bother stuck at lips. For those
whose desolation has the texture of silt, of velour
against the nerves. For days you cannot thank
your sweat: down to a toenail,
your presence is worth the awe I reserve
for newfound constellations, opening
the narrow sky above a single wall.

Coffee, toothbite, styrofoam. Styrofoam and cargo.
Outside the train stop, a hawk: how it glances upside
then side to side between each pulling
redsplash bite of fallen pigeon. Do you also stare
into the crankled dark absorbed by windows—
praying a deity of lost things might visit—
bloom your fingers at their ghosts?

Then you might feel dizzy. Here, a spell:
whether giant lavender or dwarf wisteria,
whether cedar or banyan tree, fruit-
bearing or root, concrete, quarried rock,
or arkipelago, say body, say love. May you feel easy
in your skin. May the language of ancestors
tattoo the ground you walk on,
back from all the places where their failings
gather as a congregation of mercies.

I, too, have been losing my gentleness
since the first young wound. What is thick:
the cold, the doses of exclusion, the generous
human contribution to earthly hurt, the song
that pulls me from the knot of my mouth
back toward searching the low round hills
in my only soul. My monster is a bargain,
despair dropped easy like antelope meat
into the boiling pot. It simmers
like migration, multiplies
my shadows. Reduce me to desire
in my brown-boy sidewalk stance,
down from contempt in an idling car
my tightening body remembers best.

The beat was four-four time enough
to nod at first, dipped how dreams dip
into the earth. Counting the insults
alive in your ear, the collapses,
the collapses, counting them now
grow small. Enough to hear
your body—into the groove—
expand. The stars, the city lights
who swallow them: they do not leave you,
but gleam. Like oil spill and candle
glut—like a forest burning.

I am desperate for a language to hold me
as does a water crossroads: between gravel
shimmering in the transparent above the gravel.
What is sharp and thin in me, I carry.
Like you carry: the strength
you save: the mischief you will wear again
when you return: to this place
where all that has seen famine
returns. If each day is orphan
and river to a goddess of  lost things,
as my lament also dies down to whisper
curved, horned like a dawn that knows
death, light flow into the ladle you offer—
as a seed’s journey to harvest, reaching—I drink.
