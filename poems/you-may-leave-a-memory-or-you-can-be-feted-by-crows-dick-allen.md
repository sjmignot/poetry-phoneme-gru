# You May Leave a Memory, Or You Can be Feted by Crows
## Dick Allen
Three years, Huang Gongwang
worked on his famous handscroll,
 _Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains.
_

As he put successive applications of ink to paper
over the “one burst of creation,” his original design,
it is said he often sang like a tree frog
and danced on his old bare feet.

One day, he adds one hemp fiber stroke,
the next a moss dot.

What patience he had,
like a cat who comes back season after season to a mole’s tunnel.

Honors may go to others.
Riches may go to others.
Huang Gongwang has one great job to do.

And he sings like a tree frog,
and he dances on old bare feet. _
