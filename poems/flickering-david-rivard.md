# Flickering
## David Rivard
"I see you," she says—
one of the flickering homeless with gray
alehouse hair, pale blue

eyes, crunchy lips—a methadone-
troubled moth by the YMCA—but who
does she see?—is it

the chubby, right-handed schoolboy
sent out by the nuns
at St. Joseph's to clap

the chalkboard erasers clean?
Or the giddy
teenage shipping clerk at lunch break

smoking pot for the first time
behind a curtain factory
shed? Perhaps the middle-aged

mortgagee? Maybe an ex-
proofreader in lawyerland or betraying husband?
Maybe the good loser? How about

the new father smiling in tears?
Why not
the complainer's

ally, or the devoted wanker,
or the inert
doubter, or the annoyancer

or toddler?—
if not the circumspect bald man,
crank, or

unselfish lecturer—
or does she see each of them?—
maybe each

would like
a lantern to carry;
tho there are

nowhere
near enough lamps
for all.
