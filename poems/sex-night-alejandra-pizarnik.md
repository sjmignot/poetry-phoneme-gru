# Sex, Night
## Alejandra Pizarnik
Once again, someone falls in their first falling–fall of two bodies, of two
eyes, of four green eyes or eight green eyes if we count those born in the
mirror (at midnight, in the purest fear, in the loss), you haven’t been able
to recognize the voice of your dull silence, to see the earthly messages
scrawled in the middle of one mad state, when the body is a glass and from
ourselves and from the other we drink some kind of impossible water.
         Desire needlessly spills on me a cursed liqueur. For my thirsty
thirst, what can the promise of eyes do? I speak of something not in this
world. I speak of someone whose purpose is elsewhere.
         And I was naked in memory of the white night. Drunk and I made love
all night, just like a sick dog.
         Sometimes we suffer too much reality in the space of a single night.
We get undressed, we’re horrified. We’re aware the mirror sounds like a watch,
the mirror from which your cry will pour out, your laceration.
         Night opens itself only once. It’s enough. You see. You’ve seen. Fear
of being two in the mirror, and suddenly we’re four. We cry, we moan, my fear,
my joy more horrible than my fear, my visceral words, my words are keys that
lock me into a mirror, with you, but ever alone. And I am well aware what
night is made of. We’ve fallen so completely into jaws that didn’t expect this
sacrifice, this condemnation of my eyes which have seen. I speak of a
discovery: felt the I in sex, sex in the I. I speak of burying everyday fear
to secure the fear of an instant. The purest loss. But who’ll say: you don’t
cry anymore at night? Because madness is also a lie. Like night. Like death.
