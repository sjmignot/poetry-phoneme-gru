# I Haven't Masturbated in Five Days for Fear of Crying
## Eloisa Amezcua
because we know distance too well
because the blood bank didnâ€™t have enough blood for nana & her new knee
because I see ~~your car~~ a car like yours parked across the street from my
apartment
because the same night awaits us all
because arizona  & the drought & I was seven when it started
because nana used to sleep with a belt tied around her waist so tight to wake
like an hourglass
because I wait on you
because I want to know the antonym to every word
because we speak to each other in our sleep
because I do my best thinking in the shower so I take long showers
because you kiss the parts of my body I hate most
because you can love someone & not remember their birthday
because sometimes I want the wind & it is impossible
because from the airplane I can see both oceans & where they meet
