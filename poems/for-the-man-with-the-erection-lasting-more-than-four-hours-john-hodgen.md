# For the Man with the Erection Lasting More than Four Hours
## John Hodgen
He’s supposed to call his doctor, but for now he’s the May King with his own
maypole.
He’s hallelujah. He’s glory hole. The world has more women than he can shake a
stick
at. The world is his brickbat, no conscience to prick at, all of us Germans he
can _ich_
 _liebe dich_ at. He’s Dick and Jane. He’s Citizen Kane. He’s Bob Dole.
He’s Peter the Great. He’s a tsar. He’s a clown car with an extra car.
_Funiculì_ , _Funiculà_. He’s an organ donor. He works pro boner. He’s
folderol.
He’s fiddlesticks. He’s the light left on at Motel 6. He’s free-for-alls.
He’s Viagra Falls. He’s bangers and mash. He’s balderdash. He’s a wanker.
He’s got his own anchor. He’s whack-a-doodle. King Canoodle. He’s a pirate,
Long John
Silver, walking his own plank. He has science to thank. He’s in like Flynn.
He’s Gunga Din,
holding his breath, cock of the walk through the valley of the shadow of
death. He’s Icarus,
hickory dickerous, the mouse run up the clock. He’s shock and awe. He’s
Arkansas.
He’s the package, the deal, the Good Housekeeping Seal. He’s Johnson _&_
Johnson.
He’s a god now, the talk of the town. He’s got no place to go but down.
