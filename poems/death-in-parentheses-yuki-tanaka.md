# Death in Parentheses
## Yuki Tanaka
He came home with his right leg made a bit shorter
but they didn’t notice. A landmine did it, he said
to himself, and I was the only one who heard him
because I followed him everywhere like a son.
He hobbled when no one was looking,
and I hobbled behind him.
When he plucked an iris, I plucked the one next to it,
and we thought of purple evening clouds.
When he killed a butterfly, he’d take off the wings first,
then crush it with his fingers and smell it.
I tried to catch one, but it flitted away.
He wanted to build a huge power plant
to keep us from disappearing. I nodded
and pointed out all the recent deaths, how quick they were,
tomatoes not as plump as they used to be,
the maple trees discolored, their branches
like veins with no fat around them.
All this, he decided, meant we needed new things.
But I disagreed on this: why new, why not
old me, I who have lived here for many years
even before he was born, but he didn’t listen.
Mosquitoes come and go,
full and happy. Outside the window, the plant
looms over the village. It looks prettier than I thought,
which makes me want to kiss it, but I know it will
burn my lips and I won’t be able to speak to anyone
with my charred mouth. I saw him
dressed up for a meeting, and they shouted,
blaming him for his empty head,
for wanting too much. The next time I saw him
he was in bed, old and delirious.
He opened his eyes, and held my hand
for the first time, and said, Don’t push yourself, come back
alive. He was buried in his ever-vanishing land,
and I flew off into my friendless life.
