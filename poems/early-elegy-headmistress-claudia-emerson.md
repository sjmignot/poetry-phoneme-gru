# Early Elegy: Headmistress
## Claudia Emerson
The word itself: prim, retired, its artifact
her portrait above the fireplace, on her face
the boredom she abhorred, then perfected,
her hands held upwardâ€"their emptiness
a revision, cigarette and brandy snifter
painted, intolerably, out, to leave her this
lesser gesture: _What next?_ or shrugged _Whatever_.
From the waist down she was never there.
