la herradura, s.v.—¿Do I have a mother? _Have_ her pinkie in my hand crossing
the street? _Have_ her breath on my hair as she sings arru-rru mi niño to
sleep. ¿Don’t you mean _where_? ¿What was your question? I’m older. Think more
about memory. It makes me crazy. Obsessed. Her warm breasts on my belly as she
knelt to tell me todo va estar bien. _I’ll never see her again_ was the fear
as if she’s gone, died, will never come back. I whispered it hidden in banana
groves looking at the sky hoping one of those planes would take me to wherever
she had left to. Whenever Mom hung the clothes to dry, not a cloud in the sky.
I could see her sandals picking up dust. For a second. For a second I believe
she’s back. It went like that every day. Every single night. _I’ll never see
her again_. But then, I did. Her face. Her hair. She was the same. So much had
changed. I do not remember  what it was I truly felt.
