# Cantata for Lynette Roberts
## Ange Mlinko
Lynette, the stars are kerned so far apart—
Through a herniated zodiac I almost see your _waled skylanes_ , your _shocked
Capricorn and Cancer_.
In the hundred and two years since you were born, and the sixteen since your
heart failed, and the nearly sixty since you gave up poetry, it seems we can’t
navigate by the same star chart.
I’d like to think we were fated to work the same coracle: you steering with
one hand, grasping your corner of the seine while I grasp mine; together
sweeping the weirs.

Lynette saw the sky made wide-waled corduroy by the flight paths of fighter
jets.
 _Corde du roi_ —“Cloth of the king.”
(“A baseless assertion,” states the oed.)
A fireman from the Midlands nfs said the raids on Swansea were worse than on
Birmingham, where a ten-year-old Roy Fisher gaped at the garden where his
cousins were slaughtered, and later wrote, _It was like a burst pod filled
with clay_.

Last night, Lynette, my son thought he saw his father in the jumbo jet roaring
over Cherryhurst: the weather softer, flight paths altered.
Three weeks now his father gone.

Insofar as Moses came to in a coracle, it wasn’t a Welsh one-off; it wasn’t a
hapax of vessels.
Insofar as it’s kind of a kiddie boat, not a kayak, not the royal barge the
Makah sent William Blake, aka Johnny Depp, with into the northern Pacific; not
even the Viking ship, its carved prow like an uncial; insofar as it is calico
wrapped up in tar, insofar as it is swaddled willow whippets.

“Pastoral ding-dong is out,” Lynette wrote, and no wonder— bombs hidden on the
glossy knolls.
In the sorrel.
In the tormentil.
I thought she was perhaps the closest I could get to my grandmother.
While Lynette was writing “Displaced Persons”—

                   _Neither from the frosted leaf nor from
_
                   __The grey hard ground could they find
                   __Relief

—Lydia was migrating, on foot, a thousand miles from Minsk to Hanover through
the German lines in a different tongue.
I only have this tongue, so I adopt Lynette’s epic as a stand-in.
She slipped back to childhood in Buenos Aires, garrulous in her dying, her
children spiriting a Spanish dictionary into the facil with them on visits.
 _I would see again São Paolo_ , she wrote (my mother would be reared there):
_the coffee-colored house with its tarmac roof_.
I can imagine myself down the same funnel reverting to Portuguese and the
small pure word-hoard shared between child and grandparent: _suja_ , _limpo_ ,
_bom_ , _mau_ , _com fome_ , _cansado_.
 _Porcaria.
_
Disgraçada!
Let my children bring the dictionary too.

Lynette was ardent for _penillions_ , and “experimented with a poem on Rain by
using all words which had long thin letters....”
Maybe you thrill to such things when English isn’t fully naturalized.
Hers was a poetry full of metals and alloys; air raids they were, ear raids...

I’m not so much crusted with parasangs, or dipped in leagues, as fried in
miles of a journey resembling the arc between Cleo and asp.
The jacuzzi, on a timer, sank a quarter-hour in froth on a fifty-degree
afternoon.
There were sight lines to windy breakers, heaving palms; we floated like
epiphytes grown from pond scum, flowers of the abyss.

The meliorative, moist air was soft around a gigantic neon cross.
And it’s true I found it hard to think of you with the hardness I thought of
myself.
Since it took hundreds and hundreds of dollars of posters to adorn the walls
of that apartment
(Pillsbury dough kitsch; an art deco cigar teetering on a stiletto; a wall
plaque of a trilobite fossil; photo of the Sydney Opera House at night; a
three-foot geode with its own spotlight on the end of what looked like a
colonoscope—)
since it took all that to match the bric-a-brac on the beach, the beach that
stretched to fill the picture window,
I thought it took many waves to round the facts; an asp to soften geometric
Cleopatra; and that giant cross was earth’s axis extracted—
tendering foliage over all of Florida.

I’m in the backyard weeding cotyledons.
Croton.
It’s spring.
There’s larvae noodling in the soil.
“I was rendering a ‘whipping’ stitch,” Lynette wrote, on a silk-and-georgette
petticoat, the utility of which would be tested in Dover, where Keidrych had
been called up to man the anti-aircraft guns.
Had his Conscientious Objector status been approved on appeal, no end to their
Arcadia.
Dylan read Rabelais, drank with Keidrych; Lynette visited with Caitlin.
Household talk.
Debts.
Children.
Insofar as Croton is rank with cotyledons, insofar as weeding is gleeful,
insofar as the seed case still caps their tips, I am revising the look of
spring on the face of the village.
Insofar as Moses slips through the reeds in his coracle.
 _With new beaks scissoring the air_.

Lynette’s village, Llanybri, is pronounced _clan-ubree_.
Even the _l_ ’s turn into _c_ ’s where modern warfare enters the poem as
discord: _clinic air_.
St. _Cadoc_ and _curlews_ versus _confervoid_ ; _cranch-crake_ versus
_ceraunic_ _clouds_ ; _into Euclidian cubes grid air is planed_.
Where did she get the nerve?

I pencil in her age where various dates are given: 32 when she began _Gods
with Stainless Ears_ ; 36 when she had her first child, 37 when she had the
second; 39 or 40 when she divorced.
The nervous breakdown came at 47.
Jehovah’s Witness thereafter.
Lynette, if you were here, I’d ask you the one salient question for a woman at
the midpoint of life:
How not to harden?

In Little Sparta, Ian Hamilton Finlay made an image of an Oerlikon gun and
inscribed:

 _To Apollo:
_
                                 His Music                His Missiles
His Muses

Like Lynette he observed the swarm-like behavior of fighter jets.
He saw “flame-bearing honey” in the gasoline leaked by immolated warships.
He commemorated the Flower Class Corvette, each a small naval vessel named for
a blossom.
_Alyssum_.
 _Loosestrife_.
The fragility of men in battle.
The _Loosestrife_ had eight mounts for each two-pound pom-pom anti-aircraft
gun.
This was no Arcadian ding-dong either, as the corduroy bridge Finlay built on
a stream had a line from Heraclitus on each plank:
 _That which joins and that which divides is one and the same.
_
Lynette says: _He, of Bethlehem treading a campaign_ _...._

It’s the nickel in my cheap wedding ring that brings on this rash that starts
at the corners of my lips.
The ring bought at age twenty-one, paid for with the tips from Buddy’s Crabs
and Ribs.
Which I now paint religiously with clear nail polish on the inner band, across
the names, the ampersand, where the graving bit exposed the nickel.

                _Out of this hard. Out of this sheet of zinc.
_
 ____. . . _
_
 ____We, he and I ran
 ____On to a steel escalator, the white
                __Electric sun drilling down on the cubed ice;
                __Our cyanite flesh chilled on aluminum

 ____Rail.

The _tin Madonnas_ of warplanes, writ small and annular in marriages, hammered
out in Lynette’s ear raids.

My library is wreathed in double staircases climbing to a glass dome.
I imagine birds trapped at the top, a cucucurrucued curricula, forming and
dissolving figures ad hoc.
Insofar that these are books that were ernes, atom-wise, in former eons.

The abbess of Streoneshall, Caedmon’s abbess, Hilda, was announced to her
mother in a pregnancy dream: “a most valuable jewel” delivered from under her
garments.
She wrote one of the books in this aerie, this library, wreathed in double
staircases; lodged also in subdural interfaces.
Insofar as we’re just pre-ceviche, pre-cadavers-reinterpreting-flan, Lynette,
let’s research articles, with babies at our feet: on Welsh architecture, the
potato tax, coracles...
I see you floating out to sea in your coracle, the spirit of the Makah
accompanying you as far as the Azores: halfway from a kitchen garden in
Llanybri, halfway to a _quinta_ in Buenos Aires.
