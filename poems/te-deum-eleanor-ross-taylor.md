# Te Deum
## Eleanor Ross Taylor
_Lord_
 _sho been good to me_
 __
                 My loved hoe handle, and my sweat,
heart pounding and the towhee singing.

 __ Jill, jerking the hospital sheets,
               “Damn careless nurses    ...
“But golly    ...    a good life.
 __ “That student who kept writing me.
                “That rainy picnic by a road in Burgundy.
“Heart thumping, thumping on    ...    more, more....”

                 A squirrel on a post.
The nutgrooved skull
 __ drops; he claws the dirt.
                 Next winter!
Frost thrown down,
 __ a stiffened morning,
                 a harsh corrective herb
to gnaw, take in.

 _Sho been, Lord, Sho been_
 __
                 Whether born of  kiss sublime,
victim’s terror, rapist crime, and
 __ however ending,
                 nut-gnawers nulled
inscrutably, or
 __ Caesars,
                 soldiers, friends
lammed open-eyed —

 _Lord, good_ _..._ _sho been_
