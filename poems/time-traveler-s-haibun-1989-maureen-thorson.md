# Time Traveler's Haibun: 1989
## Maureen Thorson
In the grassy space between the wings of the elementary school and the
trailers housing the fifth grade’s overflow classrooms, girls flip their hair
in imitation of Cindy Crawford, sing _Iko Iko_. None of you know what it means
or where the song comes from.

It’s honor-roll season, a time of outings to TCBY and Outback Steakhouse. Your
mother warns you against filling up on bread, but it’s hard to resist the
little brown loaves brought warm to the table with soft butter – a luxury that
cannot be imagined at home, with its always-refrigerated margarine and
Pepperidge Farm sandwich loaves.

Everyone knows what’s popular but nobody knows how to act. At ten, you lack
any context. The world swims before you, and it constantly stings. Its
favorite barb: “everybody knows that.”

Beyond the grassy space of girls is more grass, a quarter-mile loop of track,
a church with a painfully white spire, a fence, and a neighborhood maybe a
little less nice than yours, crammed between the school and busy Great Neck
Road. The fence is of chain link, instead of wooden slats. That’s how you know
about the niceness – that and the something hard, like a grain of sand, you
feel in your mother’s voice, when she takes you to the school’s Spring Fling,
where you win another goldfish. They always die, but you’re getting better.
Now, it takes a while.

 _Loblollies shiver_
 _In May heat. The world’s ending._
 _The world’s a mirage._
