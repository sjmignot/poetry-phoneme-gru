# Reading Ovid at the Plastic Surgeon's
## Emilia Phillips
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.
No one else with a book, the slick
weeklies gossip amongst

themselves on the side
tables as the ticker rolls the Dow

Jones _down down down_ under
a profile of the marathon

bombers (the older, a boxer). Jove
argues for the removal of a race

of   peoples that do not please
him: _What is past
_

remedy calls for the surgeon’s
knife. They will take a hunk of my

cheek (cancer) _&_ though I can’t
see during the procedure, I imagine

the site as an apricot, bitten.
This is a survival mechanism —

romanticism. David says,
 _If you’re out
_

in public & you don’t want anyone
to talk to you, bring a book

of poetry. Even as I enter the confidence
of   the room, I avoid my reflection

in the window, for there, most
of all, I see myself as only I can,

as only the eye will have me —
as light, as light alone.
