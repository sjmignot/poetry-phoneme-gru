I started Early – Took my Dog –
And visited the Sea –
The Mermaids in the Basement **Basement** i.e., the bottom of the ocean
Came out to look at me –

And  Frigates **Frigates** fast and highly maneuverable warships of the 18th
and 19th centuries, used to escort other larger ships, or to patrol the coast
and blockade harbors – in the Upper Floor
Extended  Hempen Hands **Hempen Hands** strong, thick ropes made of hemp, used
on ships –
Presuming Me to be a Mouse –
Aground –  opon **opon** upon the Sands –

But no Man moved Me – till the Tide
Went past my simple Shoe –
And past my Apron – and my Belt
And past my  Boddice **Boddice** bodice; an upper part of a woman’s dress, or
a rigid, laced corset worn underneath clothing, covering the upper part of a
woman’s body – too –

And made as He would eat me up –
As wholly as a Dew
Opon a Dandelion's Sleeve –
And then – I started – too –

And He – He followed – close behind –
I felt His Silver Heel
Opon my Ancle – Then My Shoes
Would overflow with Pearl –

Until We met the Solid Town –
No One He seemed to know –
And bowing – with a Mighty look –
At me – The Sea withdrew –
