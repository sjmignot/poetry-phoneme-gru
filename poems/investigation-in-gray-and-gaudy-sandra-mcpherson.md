# Investigation in Gray and Gaudy
## Sandra McPherson
“What can or ought
the public care
about
the identity
of the portrait?”

said James McNeill.
Did he look down
from neutral heaven
on the dealer wearing
flannel plaid, adjusting

to my denim chair,
to make the arrangement,
pocket my check
in black and smudge and white?
The agents said

they could easily find it
if I had no carbon.
FBI with their silk knots
and sober suiting
just like the famous oil

though on different
body parts.
I could be
Mrs. Whistler,
but I was

the dupe,
eyes lowered,
the menswear pair
noble shadows,
tracking down

the evil and clever
eBay forger (not
the original cormorant-tousled Martinez
I thought I was purchasing
with his true (M) mark

from his 19th-century hand).
Inspectors with their pointed
interrogations — they were way
beyond clues —
who when they left

would form, and be,
long shadows
at each end of day.
Make shapes you might assume
would fall

from mountain goats
in frightening terrain.
They reported answers
they knew all along.
Thigh-high in paintings,

I thought to wade out
with my honest eyes
so little notorious,
from mistaken
tonalists, expressionists,

Society of Six ...
The crook posed in tartan,
I fine-tuned
to the agents;
he talked ordinary — that was my best judgment.

So what? He warmed, and got richer in,
my denim wingback.
I thought of Anna’s
stern profile; and were they
profilers?

And as they shook
my hand good-bye, I said,
 _Do your wives collect anything?_
What do you think?
they implied.
