# The Remains
## Timothy Liu
                                                  — _Wuxi, China_

Walking out of the new cemetery, my father
takes my hand, having just re-interred the remains
of his own father and his father's two wives—
his mother dead from T.B. by the time he was ten.

He takes my hand and says, _Now I can die in peace
_
even if we didn’t get the actual bones. Village thugs
hired by my uncle made sure the burial mounds
behind the house my father grew up in would not feel

a single shovel blade go in as they stood there
sentinel with arms crossed. My uncle's wife
had a dream that out of the grave's opened gash
demons rushed—ancestral ghosts not wanting to be

disturbed. _In less than a decade, bulldozers will come
_
to take the Liu village down. My grandfather's
ashes, my grandmother's bones, my own father
walking away with two fistfuls of dirt and saying,

 _This will have to do. So many others have died
_
who’ve left nothing behind. I'll never come back
to this place again. My father kisses my hand,
I who've flown across twelve time zones to be here

at his side in a borrowed van, me looking out
the window at a countryside once overrun
with Japs marching West along the railroad tracks,
my father and his siblings hiding in an outhouse,

a dead horse found in the schoolyard soon after
the soldiers had gone. Your hands are so soft! I say
to my father. _So are yours,_ he says. _Remember
_
when it was we last held hands? I must have been

a kid, I say, maybe eight, or ten? _You were six,_
my father says. And I'm still your son, I say,
leaning into his shoulder, our hands the same size.
 _And I'll always be your father,_ my father says

before I have the chance to say another word,
my eighty-year-old father nodding off into sleep.
