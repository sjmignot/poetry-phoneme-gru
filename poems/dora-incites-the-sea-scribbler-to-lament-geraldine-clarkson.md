# Dora Incites the Sea-Scribbler to Lament
## Geraldine Clarkson
Sees him at the far end of the strand,
squamous in rubbery weed, his knees bobbing
urchins, his lean trunk leaning, sea-treasure for her.

After it all (they mate, like carapaces, in parentheses)
Dora feels coolness in new places, lifts a reused
razor shell, mother-of-pearly and straight

and signals out to the swell of moldering green.
 _Dora is electric, in love, and deep water._
 _Dora, Dora, Dora, in which dread is_.

People people the beach, peering
through splayed hands, appealing:
 _DAW-RAAaargh_. A boat sees her passing.

Sea-scribblerâ€™s chest buckles
in aftershock:
his quill is primed: squid-inked and witful.
