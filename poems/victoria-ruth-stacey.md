# Victoria
## Ruth Stacey
I am Queen and I shall do my utmost to fulfil
my duty towards my country.

 _Duty is a slapped mouth, sewn shut with cat-gut._

To my dear, loyal subjects who are assembled to show
their good humour and excessive loyalty.

 _Apes, hyenas, jackdaws: how they screech and caw._

How proud I felt to be the Queen of such a Nation,
the Crown being placed on my head, so gently.

 _But such a weight! Monstrous as a beached whale._

It was, I remember, a most beautiful, impressive moment.
My robes draped on the chair beautifully.

 _White body full of blood, bruises that bleed._

Nothing was done without his loving advice and help,
darling Albert was the other part of me.

 _FIlled with_ _life after life after life after life after life._

The only ray of comfort I get for a moment is in the firm
conviction and certainty.

 _I remember the chloroform. So blissfully empty of voices._

of his nearness, his undying love and of our eternal reunion.
Impatiently I wait and I do my _damn_ duty.
