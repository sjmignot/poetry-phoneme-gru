# Two Men & a Truck
## Laura Kasischke
Once, I was as large
as any living creature could be.

I could lift the world and carry it
from my breast to its bath.

When I looked down from the sky
you could see the love in my eye:

“Oh, tiny world, if anything
ever happened to you, I would die.”

And I said, “No!” to the hand. Snatched
the pebble from the mouth, fished it out

and told the world it would choke!
Warned the world over & over! “Do

you hear me? Do you want to choke?!”

But how was the world to know
what the truth might be? _Perhaps
_

they grant you special powers, these
choking stones. Maybe

 _they change the child into a god, all-swallowing._ _
_

For, clearly, there _were_ other gods.
The world could see

that I, too, was at the mercy of something.
Sure, I could point to the sky

and say its name, but I couldn’t make it change.
Some days it was blue, true, but others

were ruined by its gray:
“I’m sorry, little world —

no picnic, no parade, no swimming pool today ... ”

And the skinned knee in spite of me.
And _why else would there be
_

such terror in the way she screamed, and the horn honking,
and the squealing wheels, and, afterward, her cold

sweat against my cheek?

Ah, she wants us to live forever.
It’s her weakness ...  _Now I see!
_

But, once, I was larger
than any other being —

larger, perhaps, than any being
had any right to be.

Because, of course, eventually, the world
grew larger, and larger, until it could lift

me up and put me down anywhere
it pleased. Until, finally, I would need

its help to move the bird bath, the book-
shelf, the filing cabinet. “And

could you put my desk by the window, sweetie?”

A truck, two men, one of them my son, and
everything I ever owned, and they

didn’t even want to stop for lunch.

Even the freezer. Even the piano.
(“You can have it if you can move it.”)

But, once, I swear, I was ... And now
this trunk in the attic to prove it:

These shoes in the palm of my hand?
You used to wear them on your feet.

This blanket the size of a hand towel?
I used to wrap it around you sleeping

in my arms like this. See? _This_
is how small the world used to be when

everything else in the world was me.
