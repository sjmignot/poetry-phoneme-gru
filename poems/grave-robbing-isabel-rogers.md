# Grave robbing
## Isabel Rogers
Carnations are best. Or roses,
tight, before they go blowsy.
Daffodils last. Tulips are no good —
go limp soon as you look at ’em.
Lilies are OK, but mark us with rust
you can’t shift. Mam asks
too many questions. We leave the lilies.

Doug and me — we’re quick.
When the earth is fresh we circle in
to harvest. This is our meadow.
Stem first into plaggy bags we ribbon
from our pockets, then off, running
the back way to the village.

To the florist, past wreaths
and _In Memoriam_ s, where the old lady
will peer at our haul, sniff,
mebbe give us change from her pouch.
Her sleeve is more snot-streaked than mine.
And nails blacker.

Some days Mam says she don’t understand
why I leave me tea but other times
I’ve hollow legs. I shrug.
Tongue the toffee in a back tooth.
