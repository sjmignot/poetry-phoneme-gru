_what is at first a bodily impression turns out to be a condition of knowing_
--Judith Butler
    in the airport terminal I sit down in a row of chairs without looking at
the man in the chair beside me… my chair is adjacent to a narrow formica table
where I set the coffee and muffin I’ve bought… I’m tempted to look at the man
sitting on the other side of the formica table but I do not want to take a
chance and meet his eyes… a familiar animosity must be what warns me off…
warnings that I realize are chewable I’m learning are better swallowed… I
watch how this man expresses affront toward me without interrupting his focus
on his cell phone… the formica table between us isn’t wide enough for him to
have the distance from me he requires… this next  sensation has nothing to do
with what he knows… though I react as if it could… his disgust is my own as I
lie on my side my knees to my chest… in a bed I am a child with my mother her
body moving… her body wrapped too close around me… nothing about this should
surprise me… nothing is the space between one breath and the next… even if the
space is decades long…
