# I Look for You
## Solomon Ibn Gabirol
I look for you early,
my rock and my refuge,
         offering you worship
     morning and night;
before your vastness
I come confused
          and afraid, for you see
     the thoughts of my heart.

What could the heart
and tongue compose,
         or spirit’s strength
     within me to suit you?
But song soothes you
and so I’ll give praise
          to your being as long
     as your breath-in-me moves.
