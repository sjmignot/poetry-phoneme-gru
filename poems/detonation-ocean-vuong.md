## Ocean Vuong
There’s a joke that ends with —  _huh_?
It’s the bomb saying here is your father.

Now here is your father inside
your lungs. Look how lighter

the earth is — afterward.
To even write the word _father_

is to carve a portion of the day
out of a bomb-bright page.

There’s enough light to drown in
but never enough to enter the bones

& stay. _Don’t stay here_ , he said, _my boy_
 _broken by the names of flowers. Don’t cry_

 _anymore_. So I ran into the night.
The night: my shadow growing

toward my father.
