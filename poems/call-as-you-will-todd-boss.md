# Call as You Will
## Todd Boss
—retracing
trail until

the sun makes
up its mind

to leave
a wilderness

behind—you’ll
never find

the dog
who seems

(in this most
vivid of vivid

dreams) alive
and fresh,

a wish
made flesh,

who left
the leash

and now is
lost—lost

good in the
heart’s deep

wood.
