# What I Did With Your Ashes
## Amy Gerstler
Shook the box like a maraca.

Stood around like a dope in my punch-colored dress, clutching your box
to my chest.

Opened your plastic receptacle, the size of a jack-in-the-box. But instead
of gaudy stripes, your box is sober-suit blue, hymnal blue.

Tasted them. You've gained a statue's flavor, like licking the pyramids, or
kissing sandstone shoulders. I mean _boulders._

Remarked to your box: "REINCARNATION comes from roots meaning 'to
be made flesh again.'"

Stowed your box under my bed for a week to seed dreams in which you
advise me. (This didn't work.)

Opened the Babylonian Talmud at random. Read aloud to your gritty,
gray-white powder: "There are three keys which the Holy One, blessed be
He, has not entrusted into the hands of any messenger. These are: the key
of rain, the key of birth, and the key of the resurrection of the dead."
Worked myself up to watery eyes. Any intensity evaporated the instant I
stopped reading.

Tried to intuit your format, sift it from tides of void. Does shape play a
role? My watch ticked in an exaggerated way. Closed my eyes, sent forth
mental tendrils seeking the nothing of you. They curled back on them-
selves, weaving around the wing chair, a dog's leg, a lamp stand, eventu-
ally heading back toward the nothing of me.
