# Sonnet
## Louise Bogan
_Since you would claim the sources of my thought_
 _Recall the meshes whence it sprang unlimed,_
 _The reedy traps which other hands have timed_
 _To close upon it. Conjure up the hot_
 _Blaze that it cleared so cleanly, or the snow_
 _Devised to strike it down. It will be free._
 _Whatever nets draw in to prison me_
 _At length your eyes must turn to watch it go._

 _My mouth, perhaps, may learn one thing too well,_
 _My body hear no echo save its own,_
 _Yet will the desperate mind, maddened and proud,_
 _Seek out the storm, escape the bitter spell_
 _That we obey, strain to the wind, be thrown_
 _Straight to its freedom in the thunderous cloud._
