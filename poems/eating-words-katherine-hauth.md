# Eating Words
## Katherine Hauth
When you know
that  _vore_ means  _eat_ ,
you will know
that  **insectivores**  feed
            on grasshoppers, moths, and butterflies,
            mosquitoes, bees, and plain-old flies.

When you know
that  _carni_  means  _meat_ ,
you will know
that  **carnivores**  eat
            snakes and lizards, deer and lamb,
            carrion, birds, fish, and ham.

When you know
that  _herb_  means  _plant_ ,
you will know
that  **herbivores** CAN'T
            eat anything that moves on a foot,
            just foods that spring up from a root.

When you know
that  _omni_ means  _all_ ,
you will know
that  **omnivores** call

Everything
            they can suck or chew—
            sometimes even me or you—
food.
