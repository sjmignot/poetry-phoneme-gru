## Jessie Puru
The time of breathing into clasped hands
hovering over a lighter to make a flame

not knowing
that an angry man threw his eyes into the night

the belly of his shattered father
weeping rain for separation of earth and sky

harvesting bitter grudges
from minds like hardened soil

packing up the wounds with mud and whiskey
and opening doors to wait

for those curious to know
how sky maps granted our existence

how the weight of earth
pushed against tongues of oars

and our tÄ«puna pushed back
and won.
