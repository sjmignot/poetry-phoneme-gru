Sweet Marie-Anne, she thought
Being French, intellectual and brunette

Entitled her, in any Parisian cafe
To prompt service—and she was

Probably right, (as the Policeman
Later confirmed)—always provided

The situation was normal, and
She herself did not let the race down.

So that afternoon, she said to me:
“Sit by me, _mon cheri_ , and order

A drink!”—Well! The waiter came
As was his duty, only to stand aghast

At the unspeakable scandal of a
Full-blooded French woman kissing

 _“M’sieur_ , please sit OPPOSITE the lady—

“Yes, with the _sacre_ table between you, face

Written such brilliant essays in impreccable French

“On the phallus of—pardon, the merits of Negritude!
Show him my dear!” she turned to me, “Show how well

“You quote Molière, Corneille, and—” But the waiter
Was already smiling and bowing: I had passed my test.
