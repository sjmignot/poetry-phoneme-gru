# Two explanatory poems about Father / Mother Archetypes

Christ meets Peter after the Resurrection
Peter is old
Christ is reborn, rejuvenated, young
He clasps his oldest disciple to his breast:
When you were young
You wore clothes you liked and went wherever you wished
But now in old age
You will put out your hands like a child
To be dressed in clothes others wish you to wear
To be led where they want you to go ...

Peter clasped Jesus for long
And wept
Like a child

Mother Mary found Christ dead
It was left to her to clean up the mess
After that he gave that spectacular show:
The Resurrection
To dazzle the world and Time
It wasn’t the first time she was left alone:
At the foot of the Mount of Olives he told her
“Woman, what art thou to me”
At the resurrection he told the other Mary:
Noli me tangere
(Women had become touch-me-nots)
But at 15 Mary felt the womb stir
She took on world-blame to birth god’s son
Then she must’ve felt so alone
So alone and so frightened
