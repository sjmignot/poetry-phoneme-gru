# Poorly Dressed
## Bruce Lansky
I have a friend who’s not well dressed.
He wears no hat. He wears no vest.

Upon his back he wears no shirt,
so you can see there’s lots of dirt.

He wears no shoes upon his feet.
He wears no pants upon his seat.

In fact, he doesn’t wear a stitch,
so he can scratch if there’s an itch.

I hope that you don’t find him rude—
my dog is happy in the nude.
