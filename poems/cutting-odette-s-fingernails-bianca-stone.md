# Cutting Odette's Fingernails
## Bianca Stone
Who is the barber
with the straight razor
at the neck of the Mad King,
the physician of the Don
who must hold his broken feet
and cloudy wisps of hair
from between his legs
while he knows nothing?
The possibilities
are numerous—what jobs
we get ourselves into.
I feel like at this moment
I could be anyone in the world
because I could be
a hundred objects
of torture— _whatever
_
the mind can come up with
has been done, I read
somewhere and cannot forget,
these five senses at the knuckles
broken and healed,
submerged in salt water
and ice, waiting to be brought back
like the peat bog murder victims
into the century of data.
I didn’t come to perdition
I changed perdition
stood stock-still
and changed
abyss—planted something
in the dust bowl
made abandoned
in the blinding sun
and let loose cattle
knowing I used to get
obliterated and wander
the streets of New York
looking for takeout
a pair of scissors, waiting
to open me like a lily
I used to bang my head
against the wall
the audience
the neighbors used to dream it
and do it
wine glasses in the sink
against one another
in my bare hands
the world was clay
worked into something
too heavy to carry
I had to _let_ blood
the physician of my own
imbalanced humors
I experimented
all that misuse
it seems so insane now
finally, it feels unclear
in my mouth
with this vowel
that has come off me
like a soap bubble
this target of glory
a tiny bright oligarch
an opium substance
of my chromosomes
who first almost comprehended
the full moon while I held her
in a field on the mountain,
pointed at it and said _ball_ —
now her infant hand
is palm-down on my knee
like a starfish, and
her translucent fingernails
fall to ground
like the husks of old stars
wished upon, granted,
forgiven for whatever
defeat seemed so important
for so long—that desire
to be laid out on the marble
and sewn back up—
no, it all went differently—
I see it now; how
we tend to hold pain
so close, as if
it is all
we’re made of.
