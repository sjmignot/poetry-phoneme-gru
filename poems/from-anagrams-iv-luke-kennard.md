It is generally believed that the writers had to make the most of a low budget
and that this led to the grim determination of writing through restriction,
bottle episodes, and constraints. In reality the show was generously
bankrolled by Thud, but several costly set pieces had been planned which
depleted the kitty. Nevertheless, episode 4, comprising solely an intimate
kitchen dialogue between Fr. K and Adah, remains a fan favorite. “It was one
of the last things we shot,” recalls Halberg. “Kitty [Beaulieu, who plays
Adah], had really got into the role by then which was important as we wanted
to imply years of previous talk between
them. They

— That’s hardly uncharacteristic.
— Alright. There are things we don’t fathom: the “noumenon.”
— That’s better. Humor me.

— Bonded, drowned hobo.
— Oh, Eden! Oh, heeded ode!

Kantian philosophy (the **noumenon** is a posited thing, object, or event
which is known, if it is known at all, without the use of the senses), but it
soon emerges that a violent overthrow of the church has taken place, the
transept vandalized, Father K (and, we suppose, his ilk) booted out and
replaced by patsies during The Hour of Botheration. Its having been _titled_
shows that the recent event has already passed into myth — a further
indication that there is no planned resistance. This augurs very ill, and the
look on Adah’s face as Father K sobs in her lap really says it all. She
realizes that she will have to act as leader, as cheerleader, as mother, as
father to the household.
