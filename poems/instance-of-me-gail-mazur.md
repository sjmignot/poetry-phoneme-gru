# Instance of Me
## Gail Mazur
Hot hot hot, you are hot, Sun,
Glaring all over my east window
Burning, beaming, yellowing

The room. Uninterested in me
Because _I'm_ not Mayakovsky
Although I feel you insisting

 _I_ wake, that _I_ produce right now
Or perish as my uncle used to say.
Brave Mayakovsky, doomed Mayakovsky,

 _He_ could sass you, and later O'Hara
(Before they turned forty, both gone)
Sassed you and sassed Mayakovsky, too—

But when I try I know it's just another
Instance of me whistling in the dark,
Me not blazing, me not burning out.
