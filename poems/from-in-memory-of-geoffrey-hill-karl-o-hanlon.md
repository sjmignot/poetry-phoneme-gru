# From "In Memory of Geoffrey Hill"
## Karl O'Hanlon
The day glared, breathless: an eye socket.
Clouds barely shifted, and the opal sky
was sheared into dry-dazzling millions.
Yet fall in, the sky, it did not.
The mail did not go undelivered,
dogs were walked; lovers fell savagely
out of and in love, and all between.

Seven concussed days, his draft longhand
swaying like supple pillars of gray flame,
erasures; in the long nights his desk lamp
revealed the window streaked with chalk
sweated off the fen, which was England.

Once Ribera’s Jacob, now Jerome,
Ugg-booted at the piano, “The Irishe
Dumpe” from the _Fitzwilliam Virginal_
hindered by the little lion kneading
his lap. Later, the papers howling
of guignol ambush would milk
his delighting spleen as the rectory
self-veiled in evensong and dusk.

Somewhere over an inexpressive sea
of rain-sleek tiles, the contemptible
perfection of gardens, perhaps up
from the weird moonlike muteness
of the Black Country’s broken kilns
and felt absences, it came winging.
He died without dread or pain.
A sour storm rides the Levant,
rinsing the domeless yellow streets.

On the steep road to Worms Ash
the coverts take the tincture
of foxgloves, where the shade
of Housman, deadly-formal kink
still running through him, fidgets
among the cinder-like moths.
Hill makes his way to Pisgah.
