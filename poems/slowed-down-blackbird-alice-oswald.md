# Slowed-Down Blackbird
## Alice Oswald
Three people in the snow
getting rid of  themselves
               breath by breath

and every six seconds a blackbird

three people in raincoats losing their tracks in the snow
walking as far as the edge and back again
with the trees exhausted
              tapping at the sky

and every six seconds a blackbird

ﬁrst three then two
passing one eye between them
and the eye is a white eraser rubbing them away

and on the edge a blackbird
trying over and over its broken line
trying over and over its broken line
