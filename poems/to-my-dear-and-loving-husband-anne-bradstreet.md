If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
I prize **prize** Value thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East **the East** East Indies, southeast Asia,
including India; the English East India Company began in 1600. doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench, **My ... rivers cannot quench**
Compare the Song of Solomon: “Muche water can not quenche love, nether can the
floods drowne it." (Geneva Bible) Also, quench could mean to satisfy.
Nor ought **ought** Anything but love from thee give recompense **recompense**
Return payment; reward.
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
The heavens reward thee manifold **manifold** In abundance, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let’s so persever **persever** Both to continue
steadfastly, and in the Theological sense to remain in a state of grace. An
earlier spelling of the word “persevere.”,
That when we live no more, we may live ever.
