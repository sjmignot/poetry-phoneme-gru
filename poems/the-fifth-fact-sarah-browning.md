# The Fifth Fact
## Sarah Browning
For Ben’s project he must research five facts
about his African-American hero and write them
on poster board. He chooses Harriet Tubman,
whose five facts are: _Her father’s name was Ben._
 _Her mother’s name was Old Rit. She was born_
 _in 1820 and died in 1913. She was born in Maryland_
 _and died in New York_. Ben asks for advice
about his fifth fact and I suggest: _She led more than_
 _300 people to freedom_. Ben sighs the way he does
now and says, _Everyone knows that, Mom_.

So I try to remember the book we read yesterday,
search for the perfect fact, the one that will match
his four facts and satisfy his almost-seven mind.
 _Remember_ , I ask, _she was a spy for the North_
 _during the Civil War?_ It’s a hit! He writes it:
 _Harriet Tubman was a spy for the north during_
 _the civil war. It was a war between the north_
 _which is where the slaves were trying to get_
 _and the south which is where they were._
 _Before the war, Abraham Lincoln signed a form_
 _that said All the slaves everywhere are free!_
 _which is one of the reasons they were fighting._

On summer mornings, Lincoln rode his horse
to work down the Seventh Street Turnpike
close to my new home. Down Georgia Avenue
past The Hunger Stopper and Pay Day 2 Go and liquor
stores and liquor stores. Past Cluck-U-Chicken
and Fish in the ‘Hood and Top Twins Faze II
Authentic African Cuisine and the newish Metro station
and all those possibilities gleaming in developers’ eyes.

There goes Lincoln’s horse down Georgia Avenue
from the Soldier’s Home to the White House –
much cooler up here in the country, in the neighborhood,
at the hospital. And there’s Walt Whitman, the sworn poet
of every dauntless rebel the world over, hanging around
his street corner every morning to bow to the president
at Thomas Circle by the homeless guys. It’s 100 years now
since any president summered at the Soldier’s Home.
But I was born only 50 years after Harriet Tubman died,
all the centuries we drag into the next century and the next.

Writing here, in my new neighborhood, the city old
and new around me, I see Harriet Tubman
and Lincoln and Uncle Walt and the true stories
and sometimes our own despair like Washington’s
summer malaria, her 40 war hospitals, Whitman moving
from bed to bed, stroking the hair of so many dying boys.

North up Georgia Avenue in our own soldiers’ home –
Walter Reed – the boys and now girls too
mourn the ghosts of their own legs and arms
and our capacity for love. Where is their
sworn poet? Harriet Tubman born
so close. All these heroes under our feet.
