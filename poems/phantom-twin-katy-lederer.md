We did not want to be
unblessed, so we were blessed.

Long, thin wire, a little
patch where we might lay our

heads. It was this way, this
looking fore and back, a pole

held tightly in our
hands. You want to tell me

what went wrong? Confusing
shapes across a wall, depression

in the ground. The gorgeous
soldiers fought and fell. _Hie_

 _unto hell._ How we will lie in
that brave grave apart,

our aperture: a heart
that has been ruptured

absolutely by a passing God.
