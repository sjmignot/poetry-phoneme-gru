# Seventh Sphere (Saturn: The Contemplatives)
## Sun Yung Shin
No more hangings, no more gas chambers. No one allowed to remain in the center
of the labyrinth, guarding their dna from the world, from the future. No more
contemplation, no more waste. Everyone leaning toward paradise. Shields down
and the word _enemy_ will pass from memory. You are my kind.
