# Quotations from Charwoman Me
## Robin Morgan
You never asked to be a master
and God knows (if She would only say so)
that I never asked to be a slave.
Position papers, grocery lists
rain down like ticker-tape on my long-march procession
past where you cheer me on,
waving from the wistful side of—let's admit it—
barricades.

You're tired of living without any joy.
You think you're going crazy.
You need my friendship.
You're afraid to demand the right
to be afraid.
You're trying very hard.
I know that, and you can't imagine
how I wish it were enough.

I need to sleep.
I never asked for this;
you never asked.
Our twenty-five inch son
whimpers in the night
and my breasts hurt until I wake myself
and feed him.

He never asked for anything at all.
We all want just to be a little happy.

Listen, I see an older me, alone
in some room, busy on the telephone
dialing all my terrible truths.
This thing has never let me live
as we both know I might have; yet I see
this thing can cut me down
on some street or podium tomorrow—
or just let me live, alone.

Our child looks back and forth
from your face into mine, and laughs.
You worry about us, wondering if
something within us has broken.
You hold my body as if it were glass
that will cut you.
I'd stop this if I could, believe me, my beloved.
I'm dying of bitterness.
I love your forehead.
Did I ever tell you that?
