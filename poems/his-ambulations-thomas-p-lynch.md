# His Ambulations
## Thomas P. Lynch
On shanks’ mare Argyle talked to himself.
Alone, he’d carry on whole colloquies
en route to some poor corpse’s obsequies—
these dialogues, the way he kept his wits
about him, body and soul together,
fit for the wretched work of sin-eating.
Sometimes he counted words or parts of words
as if they amounted to something more
than sound and sense attuned between his ears,
as, for example, how coincident:
the way _grace_ and _gratis_ , wherefore _gratitude_
partook a kinship such as cousins do,
singing the same tune in different voices,
much as _grave_ and _gravitas_ , then _gravity_
kept one earthbound, grounded, humble as the mud—
the _humus_ , so-called, God wrought _humans_ from.
Or how from Adam’s rib was fashioned Eve—
 _bone of his own bone, flesh of his flesh_ —
whom he got _gravid_ by implanting seed,
in her unfathomably fecund Eden.
The memory of a woman’s company
would bring his ambulations to a halt
to aim his gaping face due heavenward,
the dewy air her touch, her taste, sweet salt.
