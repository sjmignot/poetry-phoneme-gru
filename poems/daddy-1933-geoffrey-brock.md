# Daddy: 1933
## Geoffrey Brock
_If one takes
_
a walk on a clear sunny
day in middle April,

when the first
willows are in bloom,
one may often see

young bumblebee queens
eagerly sipping
nectar from the catkins—

thus begins
the one book written
by Otto Emil Plath.

_It is a delightful thing
_
to pause and watch
these queens, clad

in their costumes of rich
velvet, their wings
not yet torn—

he wrote it the year after
Sylvia was born—
_by the long foraging
_

flights which
they will be obliged
to take later.
