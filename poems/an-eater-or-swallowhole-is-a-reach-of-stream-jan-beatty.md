# An eater, or swallowhole, is a reach of stream
## Jan Beatty
An eater, or swallowhole, is a reach of stream or a tidal area given to
violent currents and waves that often upset and/or suck under boats and kayaks
and the like as they are attempting passage.
-- William Kittredge
The eater, my birthmother, was speaking:

_I can’t tell you his name.
_
_You have to promise me you won’t look for him._
_He’s not a nice man._


Agitated, frenetic, the eater falling into her own waters.
Sobbing, almost wailing.

She said:
 _I’m so ashamed.
_
_I’m sorry.
_
_It was one night._


I was swirling into the streambed,
lost in the downstream plunge.

I said:
 _Can you just tell me his name?
_
_I won’t look for him._


The eater filled with water, driving
toward the boulder’s edge.

I rocked:
into the lava break,
into the fault.
