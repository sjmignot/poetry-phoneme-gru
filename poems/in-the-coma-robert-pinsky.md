# In the Coma
## Robert Pinsky
My friend was in a coma, so I dove
Deep into his brain to word him back. I tried

To sing _Hallelujah, I Just Love Her So_ in
Ray Charles’s voice. Of course the silence grew.

I couldn’t sing the alphabet song. My voice
Couldn’t say words I knew: _Because I Could
_
Not Stop for Death, He Kindly Stopped for Me.

I couldn’t remember the Dodgers and the Giants.

I tried to tell the stories that he and I
Studied when we were young. It was confused,
The Invisible Man was laughing at how a man
Felt History jump out of his thick fair head
And beat him half to death, as being the nightmare
Out of which Isaac Babel tried to awake.

The quiet. _Next time won’t you sing with me_.
Those great diminished chords: _A girl I know_.

The cold of the coma, lightless. The ocean floor.

I struggled to tell things back from decades gone.
The mournful American soldier testifying
About My Lai: _I shot the older lady_.

Viola Liuzzo, Spiro Agnew, Jim Jones.

 _And by the time I count from one to four
_
I hear her knocking. Quiet of the deep,
Our mouths are open but we cannot sing.
