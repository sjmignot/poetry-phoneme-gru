# To Ireland in the Coming Times
## William Butler Yeats
_Know, that I would accounted be_
 _True brother of a company_
 _That sang, to sweeten Ireland's wrong,_
 _Ballad and story, rann and song;_
 _Nor be I any less of them,_
 _Because the red-rose-bordered hem_
 _Of her, whose history began_
 _Before God made the angelic clan,_
 _Trails all about the written page._
 _When Time began to rant and rage_
 _The measure of her flying feet_
 _Made Ireland's heart begin to beat;_
 _And Time bade all his candles flare_
 _To light a measure here and there;_
 _And may the thoughts of Ireland brood_
 _Upon a measured quietude._

 _Nor may I less be counted one_
 _With Davis, Mangan, Ferguson,_
 _Because, to him who ponders well,_
 _My rhymes more than their rhyming tell_
 _Of things discovered in the deep,_
 _Where only body's laid asleep._
 _For the elemental creatures go_
 _About my table to and fro,_
 _That hurry from unmeasured mind_
 _To rant and rage in flood and wind;_
 _Yet he who treads in measured ways_
 _May surely barter gaze for gaze._
 _Man ever journeys on with them_
 _After the red-rose-bordered hem._
 _Ah, faeries, dancing under the moon,_
 _A Druid land, a Druid tune!_

 _While still I may, I write for you_
 _The love I lived, the dream I knew._
 _From our birthday, until we die,_
 _Is but the winking of an eye;_
 _And we, our singing and our love,_
 _What measurer Time has lit above,_
 _And all benighted things that go_
 _About my table to and fro,_
 _Are passing on to where may be,_
 _In truth's consuming ecstasy,_
 _No place for love and dream at all;_
 _For God goes by with white footfall._
 _I cast my heart into my rhymes,_
 _That you, in the dim coming times,_
 _May know how my heart went with them_
 _After the red-rose-bordered hem._
