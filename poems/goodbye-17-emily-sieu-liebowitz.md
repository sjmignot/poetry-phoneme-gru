# Goodbye 17
## Emily Sieu Liebowitz
Grown from conventional purpose
in order to rename over there
as “across state line,” in terms of survival,
Dante calls X a way to maintain courage.
& from the end of this dispatch I would’ve been a good wife

hemming distances, a little, every day,
without one wholly thing the matter.
O moon! Whatever victim of etiquette I turn
out to be, valued as customer of or friend to,
when recategorized for this present time,

my skin & skeleton are of as much
consequence as the grass that never grew under my feet.
In the skirmishes of things, is my ally
equal in measure to the I of me?
Or are we paired solely by image?

Ran short of noun-like qualities,
both of our names X-faced and
rent of whatever postwar commonalities
fooled us into individualistic days:
my good looks head for memory.

Memory, I’ve been wreckless with survivalist fame.
What other efforts are there?
The nose gone, then the jaw.
As the monetary equivalent for a decade,
fitting to join myself judge or

faction, law hath nitpicked
the grass of the first field
for the alien light of common sense.
They’ll see your heart evicted.
I see your heart evicted.
