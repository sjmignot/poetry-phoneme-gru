# The Blue World
## Joe Bolton
### 1985

The two figures are lying fully clothed
On separate beds and staring at the ceiling
As if they could see the sky through the five
Stories above them. It is dusk, and, caught
In the blue world Matisse loved, refracted
Bars of late light ordering their bodies like
Keyboards, these strangers—this man and woman—
Have forgotten the name of the city
Outside and cannot think of anything
They want. He begins to smoke, and the woman
Who doesn’t smoke, watches the tracery
Of his breath rising and lets her mind drift
With it, as if seeing herself from above.
She feels that nothing will ever happen
To her and wonders how for years her life
Has gone on and gone on like somebody
Else’s dreaming, how little it has to do
With her anymore. Then quietly, as though
His voice had come back to him suddenly,
Strange from disuse, the man begins speaking
Just to hear himself speak. The woman shifts
Imperceptibly on the cool mattress to listen,
Though the glib words she hears may as well be
Meaningless, or of another language.
She is thinking of music, of how much
Like music this man’s voice is—perhaps
Because the sky is emptying itself
Like the chord dying inside a guitar,
Or because the frail notes of the streetlamps
Seem to echo the stars. And it is like
Matisse’s Piano Lesson—this room,
This lopsided duet half-drowned in deep
Blue shade: the boy, bolt upright, practicing
The Bagatelles, maybe; the stern mother
Tricked into forgetting for a moment
Life’s cruelty; the city reduced to a source
Of light through the bay window; the pendulum
Of the metronome hung forever between beats.
