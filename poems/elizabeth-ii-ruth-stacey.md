# Elizabeth II
## Ruth Stacey
In today's correspondence a poetry book
detailing the lives of British Queens—
with a note enclosed and a question:
what does it mean to be a Queen?

I could reply and say—
this precious stone set in a silver sea:
a symbol, like a banner, for mens' love.
But these are not my words.

I could reply and say—
glorying in the glories of my people,
sorrowing with the sorrows of the lowest.
But these are not my words.

I could declare—
that each Queen is tissue paper thin,
transluscent but combined, are my flesh.
But I will not solidify my words,

instead I will command my secretary to write,
with many kind thanks for the little book etc,
but to say my thoughts on Queenship
can only be ascertained by my actions.
