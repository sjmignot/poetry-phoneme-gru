# Main Na Bhoolunga
## Fatimah Asghar
Translation: "I won't forget."
my father: sideburns down the length of his face my age now & ripe my age now
& alive his husky voice’s crackle like the night’s wind through corn fields of
bell-bottoms fields of pomade my mother’s overlarge sunglasses crowded on her
face crowded in the only english movie theater that plays amitabh bachchan my
mother watching the blown-out screen the smoke spilling from light how he is
able to be in all places at once all the places she can’t be the man on the
screen a kind of god maybe a kind of god maybe my grief at all places at once
replaying their every story a kind of god maybe my father’s nazar his long
look his luck-laced lungs breathing my mom’s hands in the theater as they
whisper next to my father’s the almost touch blood electric my father watching
her his sideways glance on her thick eyelashes so long it’s as if she never
blinks my father’s stomach blinks & blinks and a thousand amitabh bachchans
blink his insides his heart pumps _main na bhoolung_ a on beat _main na
bhoolunga_ in chorus _main na bhoolunga_ the theater singing my mother’s ghost
fingers on his palm  & maybe this is what falling in love is like: a more
handsome man jumbling the intestines a more handsome man belting the song to
the woman with the long eyelashes in the theater & you—afraid to blink in case
she disappears in case it was smoke this whole time.
