# La Tuveria or An Earring's Lament
## Peg Boyers
_En Cuba tuve_ —

I’m tired of hearing your complaints.
All that whining about _el_ _exilio_ , the tragedy of loss,

_In Cuba I had_ —

the catalogue of things, the status, the riches,
the opulence of it all.

_I had a mate. We were a pair. Our mistress was young. We_
_were young. We would dangle on her ear_

Concentrate on what you have.
Forget the past.

_and go out on the town. Mojitos at La Floridita,_
_dancing at the Tropicana and later_

No, don’t tell me about later.

_in the jewel case, an aqua Tiffany box_
_with white satin interior, we_

Tiffany’s? From New York? I didn’t know you—

_would lie together in the pillowy luxury,_
_my ruby top layer and his aligned, our bases_

Please you needn’t—

_touching, my diamond waist and his forming a continuous_
_line. Sometimes we would switch backs, I’d push_

I understand that in communities of exile
the population

_my piercing needle through his back, his_
_through mine. That’s_

tends to lose ground politically as
assimilation takes place, that

_how I liked it best, a little harsh, but sweet._
_Tu y yo, you and I, is what she called us because our very_

longing is a constitutive ingredient
of not only the condition of exile but—

_body parts were paired, he and I, forming a single unit, an I and a_
_thou. Apart_

Surely you have adjusted. Look, you’re mounted on a ring, you
are independent, and prized. Very attractive for your age, I might add.

_we are nothing. Longing doesn’t quite—_

One adapts?

_As to an amputation._

And La Revolución?

_Don’t make me vomit._
