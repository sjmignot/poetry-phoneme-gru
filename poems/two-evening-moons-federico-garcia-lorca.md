# Two Evening Moons
## Federico García Lorca
            i

 _For Laurita, my sister’s friend_

The moon is dead dead
— it will come back to life in the spring

when a south wind
ruffles the brow of the poplars

when our hearts yield their harvest of sighs

when the roofs wear their grass hats

The moon is dead dead
— it will come back to life in the spring


            ii

 _For Isabelita, my sister_

The evening sings a lullaby
to the oranges

My little sister sings
“the earth is an orange”

The moon weeping says
“I want to be an orange”

You can’t be — my dear —
even if you turn pink
or a little bit lemon
How sad!
