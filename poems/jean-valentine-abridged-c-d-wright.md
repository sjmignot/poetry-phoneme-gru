# Jean Valentine, Abridged
## C. D. Wright
Valentine's palette is mostly grey. Next comes blue (borage, cobalt, silk,
robe,
egg). Then white. Some inherent greens. But she draws most often from the
greyer end of the grey scale. It could be manifest in a postmortem jaw, dusty
glass,
a sky, one degree Fahrenheit, a lone sock under a sickbed; the water is grey,
and
the long wall where one exits a car. Grey is the intermediate state she
inhabits with
no apparent effort. In the grey space, the bardo, the spirit starts to find
shape, to
find internal structure.
