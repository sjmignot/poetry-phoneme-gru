# Conversations with the Artist (2)
## Rebecca Morgan Frank
My first teacher told me
               that what sculpture involved
was being a God. He was not talking

about the old ways, about fashioning
               a man out of a rib.
Out of the earth. A god can see something

that does not exist yet in the world. Who
               could have imagined the giraffe,
the octopus, the flounder? Who

could have imagined our sharp sensibilities,
               our contortions? The materials
are all there—eyes and blood and respiration,

but still, they get made new. Now I know
               that these days such a view
is against science, but the idea of a god is as real

as god is not. A scientist who sees
               what has been done
versus one who can make straw out of gold.

Or more like plastic out of petroleum.
               Paper out of trees. You
have to decide which kind you will be.

We’re mistaken when we equate the wise
               and the prophetic. You’re always
looking either backwards or forwards.

This piece puts you on a precipice.
               It’s up to you
which way you fall. You see—it’s all there.

The scientist and the artist were once one—
               how else could you record
what you saw? How else, find a way of seeing?
