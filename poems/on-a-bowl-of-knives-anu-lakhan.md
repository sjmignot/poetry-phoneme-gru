# On a Bowl of Knives
## Anu Lakhan
Small words craft a spell
for honey-scented light;
a white sail flung to earth
makes a river of cold and diamonds,
makes blood shiver.

This is an old string
undone, useful as a lie
to the dreaming,
sleeping like water in the veins,
used to the hunger
of the unfed.

Taste is the shape of lovers’ hands,
the arched sky, a bowl of knives,
that tame bird in blue—
your name is
the squall and surrender
of things to come.

Night is for never,
bloodshot hours and the must of books,
breath of moth-winged longing.

Pack your things:
strike out before light.
