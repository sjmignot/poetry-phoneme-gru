# Venus' Boyfriend
## Rachel Sherwood
She sat on his lap for hours
pressed his face to her
large pink breasts    her hands
moved through his hair
like fond snakes

she gave him curls, cleft
hooves beneath the flesh
marvellous flesh, and smooth shoulders

she taught him
how to use his tongue
to shape a heart
from a piece of ice.
