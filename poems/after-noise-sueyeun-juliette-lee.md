# After Noise

and who are you now
       in this different blue space without pain
   remarking on chemtrails and snowmelt,   misreading the “sea”
whose letters cease to arrive

     remain transfixed in midflight       turbulent coasts
aloft as a principle of life--

        count invisible clams under nameless sands
   cut apostrophes into the air     announcements
 send far-flung greetings to strangers for days
          keep the magma enigma at bay        daily joys

        _effaced vaporous pale generous smoke rising_

      so cling to the dark hand inside you
  its basalt fingers, rounded
