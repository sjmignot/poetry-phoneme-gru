# My House
## Rae Armantrout
A vine drapes the fence
in its cool enthusiasm,

stemmed cascade.
My skin

has collapsed in flounces,
in anticipation.

Look how I change the subject
without changing,

I appear to say —
which seems like nothing

but is practice
for the bigger change
to come.


•


My mind is just
like the stance

and disposition of these trees —

dense, sparse, conical,
lopsided, frilly

(as was the mind
of the tenant before me
