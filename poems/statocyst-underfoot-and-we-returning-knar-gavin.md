# Statocyst underfoot and we, returning:
## Knar Gavin
The news, descriptive. Rhetoric, void. It’s finally here: _inarticulate
_
brachiopods have no matching teeth and sockets
and their valves are held together only by muscles —


wherefore the ball to fit the change?
unto what did she say, “change is a hard thing”

— woman thumbs for four pennies — currency is that which hinges —
chain to door swung open


— the hammocking tree just some yards downhill
bears that crux of certain lightning —

stilled, any young boy climbs under —
black root tangle — struck essence
rising through each dendrite of tree
charred spindle bone of dog buried the summer
before, a cave where the trunk cracked wide

tree now near-preacher, arms wide-flung,
ligature in a voiding smolder


and so, _ay-ay_!                   hold it — just

— we’re gonna talk clams for a sec
and you’ll listen, ear,
chamber that cannot refuse —


here, quickly: _Branchiopoda_ is not to be confused with _brachiopod_ ;
not to be pulled into the question of _articulacy_. Not a hand
in gesticulating fit. Skin articulates denouement —
articulates _more French than ever_  — articulates joint’s claim, that bone.

Boy, _tree_ , you’ve got some _nerve_.

And we’re back:


_inarticulate brachiopods_ / _untoothed hinges_ / _muscles more complex,_
sure, so
___articulate brachiopods_ / _toothed hinges_ / _simple opening_ / _closing
muscle—_


Lock down and ready, this is barbecue. Speak a word and tooth
that hinge, malign those swinging doors. I’m throwing all the clams in —
making each swaddle explain its wrap —

in the distance the great tree too dendrite to handle
itself splits in two. To solve this matter of teeth, I try thinking
ribs run the breadth of the body, always away from themselves.
