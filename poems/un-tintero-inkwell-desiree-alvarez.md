# "Un Tintero," Inkwell
## Desirée Alvarez
              Anger is the other person inside
                            _mi garganta_ , my throat.

                            The mouth’s mouth is the deepest.

Rage is the homeless boy fallen down a well.

Shout down and he will echo back.
                                          _La lengua_ , tongue.

How long have you been down there?

                            _Subterráneo_ , underground.

The letters of Cortés are difficult to read,
                            on each page a horse dies.

The lord of the city lives homeless in a canoe.
Hundreds of natives are speared.

              Another town is burned alive
              with all its caged creatures.

On each page the people appear to walk
                                                        over their dead.

 _La tierra estercolada_ , the earth fertilized,
spreads a cloth whose pattern repeats.

                            On each page the future arrives
on a raft woven of snakes.

              Over and over, the design obliterates.

Never does he say this was their home we took.
