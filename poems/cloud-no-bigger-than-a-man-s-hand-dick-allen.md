# Cloud No Bigger than a Man's Hand
## Dick Allen
It approaches from the sea, too small
For thunder and lightning
But ominous as a closed fist
And what it will bring

Nearing us, growing larger,
Is completely unknown.
 _Beware the leaves blowing, beware
_
The spot on the sun.

All is turned toward it. It rides
The brow of the mind.
Soon, it will shadow one cliff
And a small coastal shrine.

 _Beware the leaves blowing_ , _beware_
 _The spot on the sun_.
Do your work well. Behold
The work yet to be done.
