# From "Moon Sonnet"
## Lily Zhou
Based on the Chinese myth of Chang'e
Saturday. The good bread set out for the dogs to eat.
The rabbit hurt on milk & tall willows

that I’ve bound to storefront. The headlines say
the waves are coming in today. The waves

& spoiled fruit & all the lives I’ve wasted
playing archer. At least this side of the kingdom

will still love me. I pull the weeds. I pull the tides
& storm the shores. The rabbit drops its mouth

into a crater. The waves overtake the red city
with spears in hand. June & the headlines

announce the end of the world. I am terrible
at playing heroine. I’ve done all I can: plucked

the apples, swept the chimney. Washed the rabbit,
saved the tortoise from its slow drowning.
