# Tarragon, Are You a Wild Boar?
## Vi Khi Nao
Tarrargon, are you a wild boar?
My friend, lemon zest, has not been that
Thyme, Cognac, _falooda_ glass noodle
These things prowl the night without cape
Gooseberries or bacalao

Tarragon, are you a wild boar?
Each time I eat you, I stop breathing
Little owl, where is your happiness?
Wake up + make people believe
In you, gastrique + steaklette
Is that chive embarrassed?
To be with the savoy cabbage?

Tarragon, are you a wild boar?
I was born female, hyper-focused
Let me trim your skirt, halibut
It’s dragging salt against my oregano
Buttered by butter in no butter

Tarragon, are you a wild boar?
It’s too bad the caper isn’t wearing
A cape when the Peruvian potatoes
Are sitting on a bed of coals while
Floating down a river coconut
On the verge of falling off
A truffle, which is a
Shadow floating inside of a shadow
