# The Transit of Venus
## Susan Firer
The poppies start as aliens
end as husbands, a pause
of light, a dull scatter.
Transports dandelion clouds.
Venus passes between sun &
earth. Exceedingly rare, Transit,
have you noticed how close
the ode & elegy are?
(In the United States someone
dies every sixteen seconds!)
Husband, Supermoon, Venus
come & go. Death says there
is no you at the end of weather.
"Among the rarest of all predictable
astronomical . . ." Husband
presented me. The weatherman
says we are locked in the clouds.
