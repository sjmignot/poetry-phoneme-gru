# Our Wandering
## Dawn Lundy Martin
_If they would only just beat or shoot me, but they wanted soul substance, to
harbor that like that, so I could never move from this place. So they reach
crackled hands inside and hold it open for raking ..._

We in a shit
rustle, the way
in ramble and camaraderie,
brown hand of whose mother
makes its smooth noise
over my mouth?

The burden of saying
some _thing_ , a head-
nodding, and I want to be in-
side of your knowing. Who
laid their head
on the disappeared’s pillow?

One minute a person licks your ear,
the next, you cannot see your own white breath.

We gotta head
on over to the party way
out in Bushwick because we’re lost,

and our flesh is on fire. There’s
a man walking behind us. And growing.

This is what I tell him:

I am not a boy in anyone’s body.

I am not a black in a black body.
I will not kowtow inside your opposites.

How the world blisters you.
How hunger left you statued.

_One falls past the lip of some black unknown, where time, they say, ends._

We got us a sugar-
mouth, a bit feeding,
walk in circles in circular rooms
built so precisely for our shapes,
hold the figure that is the body that is,
of course, me.

I stroke the feather that feeds me,
that lines my cage floor with minor luxuries,

I say “mama” in its wanting sugary mouth.

What is the difference between ash and coal,
between dark and darkened, between love
and addiction on Dekalb at 2 am, and I fall
drunk from a ruinous taxi, already ruined
from _before_ before, the absent weight screams
into your breath, _you are no good, no good_ _..._ __

The space between _I_ and _It_. Lolling.

The Ibibio man was not born in his cowboy hat.
Even his throat must ache like tired teeth.

_Look what I am holding! Not desire, but infinite multiplicity, the mouth of
existence._

To sing the blue song of longing, its webbed feet along jungle floor. What of
our mechanical arm, our off-melody? Purpose in the gathering, I know, dear
self. It rains and we think, God, or we think Universe. I say, portent across
the wind. When wind is wrought, whole song fallen from its lip, some black
unknown, where they say, time ends. What speech into hard God breath just as
night park is godless? What of a silver cube in the mouth? _This_ is our
wandering.
