# What Time It Gets To Be
## Martha Zweig
I was just getting to that.
But first, old age.
If you could just let me finish.

Once it was I who rudely
interrupted proceedings: the chair rapped
 _&_ called to order, but I seized from pending

approval the minutes _&_ ran
off with the handsome mustachioed
night watch. Matching wits we wound up
jangling on a motel
bureau in simultaneous
alarm _&_ ran down
together to silence,

 _Bide-a-Wee_ ’s appointed
guest in his sleep deceased
so far from home he didn’t know
a soul. A what? We heard
Gideons rustling in the drawer,

 _&_ as we rifled the fellow’s bags before we fled,
_&_ fled, his time flew too,
from his cuffs _&_ __ collars flapping ahead.
