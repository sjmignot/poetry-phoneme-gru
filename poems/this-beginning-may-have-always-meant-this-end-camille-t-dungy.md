# this beginning may have always meant this end
## Camille T. Dungy
coming from a place where we meandered mornings and met quail, scrub jay,
mockingbird, i knew coyote, like everyone else, i knew â€¨cactus, knew
tumbleweed, lichen on the rocks and pill bugs beneath, rattlers sometimes, the
soft smell of sage and the ferment of cactus pear. coming from this place,
from a place where grass might grow greener on the hillside in winter than in
any yard, where, the whole rest of the year, everything i loved, chaparral
pea, bottle brush tree, jacaranda, mariposa, pinyon and desert oak, the
kumquat in the back garden and wisteria vining the porch, the dry grass
whispering long after the last rains, raccoons in and out of the hills, trash
hurled by the hottest wind, the dry grass tall now and golden, lawn chairs,
eucalyptus, everything, in a place we knew, every thing, we knew, little and
large and mine and ours, except horror, all of it, everything could flame up
that quickly, could flare and be gone.
