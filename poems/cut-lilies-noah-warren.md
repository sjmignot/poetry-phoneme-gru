# Cut Lilies
## Noah Warren
More than a hundred dollars of them.

It was pure folly. I had to find more glass things to stuff
        them in.

Now a white and purple cloud is breathing in each corner

of the room I love. Now a mass of flowers spills down my
        dining table—

each fresh-faced, extending delicate leaves

into the crush. Didn't I watch

children shuffle strictly in line, cradle

candles that dribbled hot white on their fingers,

chanting Latin—just to fashion Sevilla's Easter? Wasn't I sad?
        Didn't I use to

go mucking through streambeds with the skunk cabbage
        raising

bursting violet spears?—Look, the afternoon dies

as night begins in the heart of the lilies and smokes up

their fluted throats until it fills the room

and my lights have to be not switched on.

And in close darkness the aroma grows so sweet,

so strong, that it could slice me open. It does.

I know I'm not the only one whose life is a conditional clause

hanging from something to do with spring and one tall room
        and the tremble of my phone.

I'm not the only one that love makes feel like a dozen

flapping bedsheets being ripped to prayer flags by the wind.

When I stand in full sun I feel I have been falling headfirst for
        decades.

God, I am so transparent.

So light.
