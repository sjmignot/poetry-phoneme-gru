# (The) Undernamed
## Evan Kennedy
I'm oblivious to half the things going on,
and when I hear my name
it's like, Oh, hey, let's go.

A weeknight baseball game pledges its ticket holders a variety of extravagant
processions and dalliances, and I am only one of its frequent enthusiasts
spinning the turnstiles. Evenings here become lessons in piety, a refrain
reduced to the simplest expression of worthier hungers. Troublesome, splendid
concerns—how to carry myself like and through the city, how to enclose myself
within some private calm—engage me at every level in the open-air stadium, and
I ascend each level because I sit within the cheapest. Among the wind-whipped
flags, I carry out a similar lashing upon myself with my mind’s tongue, albeit
with good humor since I have yet to arrive at a serious period of my life. But
of all cities, this one understands bouts of seriousness, and whether someone
in the clutches of such crisis decides to change his life, there will be no
objection among the ticket holders. Litter swirls and sweeps itself past them.
Wildly customized hats aslant on children’s heads orbit the condiment table. A
bearded boy stands haloed by the glowing hoard of cut spuds sitting beneath
heat lamps. Like a cascade of song, endless beverages pour from trumpetlike
spouts. I am still fair-skinned, perhaps a bit queer and dangerous, but
childlike—a bizarrely perfected image of masculinity and prowess delivering my
sinewy frame through this. I have always been barked at by certain types _go
evolve._

I’ve been maligned, as you and this city know, while
I wreck my physique by staring down

barrel-chested men. My slim body—over-extended
and sickly with the blackest slice of bread it could acquire—

my incredible body used to be berserk
with lust but now lives in the jubilee of my meekness.

The open within this could bear
passage for a terrific ship of my serious griefs,

but it’s fine to stay buoyant through my naïve
affection. I am X years old and still talking

like this—incredible. Just incredible
that the calamity that is my innocence

gilds a pleroma unique to the day when the earth
again of this city will fall apart.

Call me freak—every man is a masterpiece but
what is it to confuse this many creatures.

The exaltation aware that
I’m no longer dressed
               in just flesh and blood—

I found firmament between my
helmet and skull.



Death was learning to speak
through conjecture that our
skinny long-haired pitching phenom
had irreversibly lost
                                        his finesse.

Called my body Brother Donkey,
was burdened with all that impedes
                                        resuscitation—


❖


Humility of pacing, diligence of recall,
set forth for me a taxonomy of announcements

by which I may sequence these feelings
toward a higher order of praise.

Children have been raised by wolves,
and even birds are overheard to answer questions,

yet few inhabit that zone which adheres
a beast's meekness to a human’s persistence

of self-effacement—all against a weaker
physique and panic throughout asserting itself.

A wilderness contains no diamond. And because a diamond has been built for us,
we must be distant from regions that threaten our civility. I speak about
civility with a laugh, of course, but it’s good-natured. “The universe falls
apart and discloses a diamond,” according to the dictation transcribed by Jack
Spicer, who was not quite Francis of Assisi, though both spent their lives in
despair making toys to amuse the infant Christ. Whether the voice of dictation
resembled that of our home team’s radio announcer or the San Damiano
cross—“Francis, rebuild my church”—is a matter of taste, such as taste in
furniture. At any rate, Hunter Pence grounds into yet another double play, and
we are stuck in our deference. A city could be built out from the baselines of
a diamond. Far from the hospital near where I live and where Spicer died, the
city’s edge meets wilderness, and my reception crackles—how’s yours. I am
trying to design my solace at a point shared by different stations, but the
ballpark seagulls become a menace to my anxious antenna. Most nights they
circle overhead until game’s end when it is safe to ransack the leftover food,
but in an inning distended past anyone’s enjoyment—a hangover’s early
arrival—they settle upon the outfield. Their skepticism must be a sad sight
for the rookie at bat, a spooky parody of messianic expectation. I mean we are
smack-dab within a quiet, null moment of life (on earth) winding down to a
supposed eternal hurrah deemed paradise.

These mornings I bike within a lyrical
but discreetly resonant rule
where I recite
a settlement among recalcitrant systems
to axe the psychopomps
that took
the best out from us
to some distant historicity.
They should fear it when
I am so employed. I’m recently
defined as a maker
of my own oxygen, haircut,
and enjoyment.

Today I wanted to dissolve into
the Giants victory procession up Market.
It’s possession of a desire to be rid of
my body
but also to join this party because
we’ve been fledged into city living,
the captivation to
a melodic apokalypsis.


          Don’t humiliate love by doubting these poems.
