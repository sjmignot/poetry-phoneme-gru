# At the Other End of a Wire
## Sandra Lim
When he called, there were 261 emotions
at play. I thought there were only wistfulness,
humiliation, and mere bitterness left, but lo,
I see now the brilliance in the numbers.
Emotions 75 and 78 made me happy just to know
they existed. I felt less alone, more impervious.
I was emboldened by the existence of 152.
Though, how was I supposed to accept 9, 14, and 179?
We deserved better, distress and indigence aside.
Something about 260 broke the spell inside me
and offered up a tiny shift: I opened my eyes in the fog
and tore off the surfaces of 261 and 4 with a great shout.
