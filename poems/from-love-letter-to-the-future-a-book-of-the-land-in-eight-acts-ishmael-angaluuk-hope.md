# From "Love Letter to the Future: A Book of the Land in Eight Acts"
## Ishmael Angaluuk Hope
act 1, scene 1: do you know what it means for our survival?

Fog spun into silk
              on the knee of the comptroller,
              propelled toward the crest of Ontario,
              the old, faded star, steambreath onto the windshield.

To orient in the finest sense
              of cackles, mute chrysanthemums,
              funneling inordinate nakedness,
              absorbed, absorbed, immediately absorbed.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh,
we stay
limber,
each line
choreographed
from a tremendous mouthful
of swamp, skunk cabbage
              brining at the jowls,
              acquiesced to pestilence,
              and exaggerated diffidence.

Do you know what it is to clamp your shell
              an extra foot into the silt riverbank,
              kissing the soles of passersby,
              silky grains churning the earth over?

Makeshift ceremonial dances,
              fine textiles culled from thrift store bins
              display brightly-colored throats who feed
              stacks of cash killed on recycled names.
There is a golden tapestry
              on the berry-stained
              bottom of Wealth Woman’s
              basket of abalone.
              Beneath it are the exhausted
              faces of her babies
              grown old in the length
              of the inhale, and a facsimile
              remains from all the cycles
              spilled over, since nature
              cannot acid wash, since
              frizz canvassing the ozone
              always carries over.

Geometry for days, countless days,
              spin-cycled through a craftsman’s
              circumpolar hands. There’s always
              another grotto or chamber
              where things dwell, they say.
              Wandering skitterers we are,
              the Northern Lights vacuum pried-open skulls.
                            We cover ourselves with hides and entrails,
                            overripe elderberries, looking to steal a moment
                            of letup from the glare. The limbs of the Old Ones
                            shunt aside bare toes, stripped solid
                            and indifferent as a bear’s den
                            or an ant’s apartment.

Don’t be so much in charge, the frogs say,
              of coalescing wolverine trails
              huddled in 60-million-year pellet tracks
              when the wetlands dried out.

The way soaked, green corpuscles
              rasp each other’s mouths and hands
              braiding the woof of God’s mind,
              that’s how it is, says
              the giant rat’s captive wife.

Even if you can only faintly hear
              the eighth narrative told in the corner
              of the babbling wooden-slat house,
              that is enough leftover hooligan grease
              for the gods with killer whale ganglia.

Knuckles rasp proscenium floorboards,
              splattering herring peck at scops owl’s waist,
              spruce branch
              lowered,
              scrapes conglomerate bedrock.

 _Mother-in-law’s atonic hands lunge for stewed milt._

One can conclude it’s a virus
              to plant burdensome layers
              of topographic crust on self-renewing
              limbs, like there was more to it
              than rustling fingers at the end of the line.

All components must be in order,
              or it’s an ulcer here, a bladder infection
              there, a baked-out parking lot,
              fizzing in trampled-over, chastened hairlines.

Hold, hold, hold, hold in your palms
              the Steller’s jay that beats its wings
              on glaciers lying high and straight
              over rivers slicing into cool nettles.

Sea lions suck up a quick breath, dive
              and waft on the outskirts of ballerinas
              who gyrate in like-mind
              to classics bubbling up from Sedna’s citadels.

I’m here to show you what you can do
              with this sandbar dialect,
              says the humpback whale
              and the goatsbeard moss, and the ore
              of iron oxide in the shoreline cliff.
You must trust, she says,
                            your swimming blood, joints
                            lumbering in shadows, the dolphin
                            clicking out to you, far above ground.
                            And we should feed just as much as eat,
                            says the heart your body formed around.
