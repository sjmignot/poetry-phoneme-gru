# The Paleontologist's Blind Date
## Philip Memmer
_You have such lovely bones,_ he says,
holding my face in his hands,

and although I can almost feel
the stone and the sand

sifting away, his fingers
like the softest of brushes,

I realize after this touch
he would know me

years from now, even
in the dark, even

without my skin. _
_
Thank you, I smile—

then I close the door
and never call him again.
