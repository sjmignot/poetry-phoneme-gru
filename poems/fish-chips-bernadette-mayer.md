# Fish & Chips
## Bernadette Mayer
I saw another ladybug
Chicago could win
if  I eat the leftover fish & chips
in every line so I don’t forget
We went to the river called fish & chips
We stayed at the fish & chips tower
They donated a million dollars to the fish & chips foundation
so we could go to school for free
It’s called fish & chips college for women
