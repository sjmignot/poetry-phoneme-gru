# Earliest Memory
## Sharon Olds
### 1989

Light—not bright, but deep. No beams,
light like heat, enclosed, a roomful
like a mouthful of light. And bars, upright, that
interrupt the light, stripe it
evenly: light, bar,
light solid as pond water,
bar a bluish shadow, another
amber hand of light, someone
moving across it. Into the narros
door of the bar and out again,
through the perfect intervals of
light, dark, light, the figure
ranges slowly, freely. The bars
do not waver—vertical, still, they
hold. The light does not dilute, it is
full, steady, within it the person
moves, large and calm, back and 
forth, back and forth, and at times,
behind and above her, for a moment, the white
angle of the wall and ceiling
bent like a wing, border of the sweet
box of the room where she swam in light,
delicately striped, where I lay, whole and watched.
