### 2000

In Joe Priskulnick's darkened kitchen the face
of Jesus appears on a dish towel, but no one's awake
to bear witness. Next door to the fenced truck yard
behind my father's grease shop where all time stopped
there's a hive of activity. You're thinking
the rats found a wolverine or the guard dogs
caught another kid strung out on crack. You're thinking
two thousand years passed in the blink of an eye
and changed nothing, the eaters went on eating,
their crazed teeth clicking with delight. You're thinking
that's my mother rising from the ashes of her years,
her robes signed with axle grease, her hair stained
by the new dawn. It's not. It's not Joe Priskulnick
either, for Joe's gone west in a box, it's not
my father come back after sixty-seven
years in the wrong direction, into the earth
that gagged on motor oil, the earth that gave back
wild phlox, flags, weeds, unasked for each April.
You're thinking the dawn won't break, that time will end
because it must, and the face of Christ will blaze
in the darkness of a loveless century
while the cat and the mouse slumber side by side
in this impossible kingdom. Tomorrow
is on the way, an hour ago the sun broke
through the thatched roof of Rassan the Messenger
scarring the silent forehead on which the ants
replayed their games. Before you can blink the light
will blister the gray hair of Margaret Baxter
and reveal two hands swollen like potatoes
and crossed on her breast. Let Scotland mourn her loss,
let the waves off Scapa Flow work less and less
as the departed join the patient families
of the drowned. Let us honor her life with a feast
of potatoes, the million and one she peeled
and scrubbed, and garlic and onions for Andres,
those fruits of his labor, of his one lifetime
in Haskel, New Jersey, where he now resides
in the Catholic funeral home without paz,
dolor, merced, with no one to speak his name
or sing him lullabies. Let the new day
break on the fenced yard, let it fill the kitchen
with light overflowing the stained shot glass Joe
left behind, the grail of his hopes, let it rust
with animal blood the blurred face of Jesus
on the Shroud of Michigan and westward move
across blackened Gary, the frozen prairies,
the great divide, to find us in the valleys
of our living where we surrendered our names
and natures, all that made us human, let it
go on, this empty fraction of eternity,
to die at last in the ocean of its birth.
