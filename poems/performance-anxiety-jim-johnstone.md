# Performance Anxiety
## Jim Johnstone
I write: _the tall grass is a third wish_

then back away

from the field. If I move
back

far enough, everyone in the front row
will be still.

Be still—
you’re witnessing my first time.

A ballooning ballroom expanding

until the beat drops,
a letdown

letting you down gently

before the DJ jumps up, afraid to play
something that could offend.

I write: _the tall grass is a third wish
_
wasted

and pray

for more wishes as the grasslands end.
