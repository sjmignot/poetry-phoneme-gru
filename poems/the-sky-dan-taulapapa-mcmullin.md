# The Sky
## Dan Taulapapa McMullin
The sky is bright with stars
After a hot day
The coolness of my body
Leaving finger by toe in the heat of the spa
Looking through the garden lights
At tall houses around me
I thought, No, just happy
The night is bright with stars,
She told me
She no longer missed her parents
But you loved them, I said
I did, said she, more than myself
And now Iâ€™m free
That was my friend Pipi
Such a whore, I said to myself
Like me, such a whore like me
As I hear the roosters of Samoa
In the laughing of coyotes
