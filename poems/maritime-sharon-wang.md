Did you ever feel this. Astonished
by the blood drawn from
your arms when you took a step forward
and the air scraped you.

Maybe you think peace. Think it
as a floral carpet, a persistent scent
that is supposed to be
a memory you treasure. Only
it was put there by someone else.

When the sun hits
it feels like something.
Someone cooks soup.
You love a person you envy.
And the emotions wash
into a teacup
and you drink them
and your teeth are storm-stained.

If there were a wave,
blue-black, flooding lives out,
spinning each person
and the next
and their needs
together as if they were fabrics
in a laundry machine,
could I ever trust it? If I touch
and you forget
you have borders against nature.
We’re floating somewhere
in a primordial pool.
And I’ve got you, and I’ve got you.
