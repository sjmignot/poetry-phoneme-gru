# Imperatives for Carrying On in the Aftermath
## Natasha Trethewey
Do not hang your head or clench your fists
when even your friend, after hearing the story,
says, _My mother would never put up with that_.

Fight the urge to rattle off statistics: that,
more often, a woman who chooses to leave
is then murdered. The hundredth time

your father says, _But she hated violence,
_
why would she marry a guy like that?—
don't waste your breath explaining, again,

how abusers wait, are patient, that they
don't beat you on the first date, sometimes
not even the first few years of a marriage.

Keep an impassive face whenever you hear
 _Stand By Your Man_ , and let go your rage
when you recall those words were advice

given your mother. Try to forget the first
trial, before she was dead, when the charge
was only _attempted murder_ ; don't belabor

the thinking or the sentence that allowed
her ex-husband's release a year later, or
the juror who said, _It's a domestic issue—_

 _they should work it out themselves_. Just
breathe when, after you read your poems
about grief, a woman asks, _Do you think
_

your mother was weak for men? Learn
to ignore subtext. Imagine a thought-
cloud above your head, dark and heavy

with the words you cannot say; let silence
rain down. Remember you were told,
by your famous professor, that you should

write about something else, _unburden
_
yourself of the death of your mother and
 _just pour your heart out in the poems_.

Ask yourself what's in your heart, that
reliquary—blood locket and seedbed—and
contend with what it means, the folk saying

you learned from a Korean poet in Seoul:
that _one does not bury the mother's body
_
in the ground but in the chest, or—like you —

you carry her corpse on your back.
