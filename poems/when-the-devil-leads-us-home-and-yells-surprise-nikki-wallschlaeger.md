# When the Devil Leads Us Home and Yells Surprise
## Nikki Wallschlaeger
Is that your house he asked
This used to be my house I said

But those are not your people
So that can’t be your house

But it is my house I said
I had some people maybe a few

Even though those are not your people
Even though they don’t look like you

I had to live somewhere I said
This is the house where I lived

But where are your people he said

My people live in a different house
They don’t care to know about me

If you’re the devil
Why are you asking me questions

The devil said since the house
You had to live in is gone
I thought you’d be happy

It sure is a hot day I said
Of course it is said the devil
Why do you think I work in town
