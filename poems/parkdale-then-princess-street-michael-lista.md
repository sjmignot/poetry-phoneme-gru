# Parkdale, then Princess Street
## Michael Lista
Make them say yes before you even ask,
 _L’essence de charme_ , _c’est ça_. The mind’s a damsel
Locked in a tower with her fathom of   hair.
Coax the braid and it’ll all be over.

The rooms are plain where I am interviewed,
Abstract and clinical, and so I glory
Like a corpse plant, perfume the marble-faced
With the reek and prodigy of my tomorrows.

Dying is so boring as the soul
Rummages the liquidation sale
For a final bargain —

But time outbids all comers, and we die
Expensively in Princess Margaret
Who was herself once so beautiful.
