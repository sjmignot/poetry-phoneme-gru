# Word
## Eamon Grennan
There's a word you've met but once and now forgotten
               for the spoon-shaped concave under your Adam's apple:
a small pouch that must be kissed and kissed again
               by lovers learning the ins and outs of one another
and where last night in the sleeping dark a lone mosquito
               inserted itself and drew fresh blood and left
venom and a couple of love-bites
               then left without waking you although this morning
you'll blaze with the minute but unassuageable
               pain of them—which only that word that's vanished
into the mud of memory might be the right cooling balm for.
