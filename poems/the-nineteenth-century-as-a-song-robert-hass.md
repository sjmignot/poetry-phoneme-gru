and that gentle man  Bakunin **Bakunin** Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876) was a
Russian anarchist who participated in the Czech Rebellion of 1848. Bakunin met
Karl Marx in Paris, and later Bakunin’s anarchist faction would clash with
Marx’s socialist faction at a congress of the International Working Men’s
Association, and Marx’s leadership prevailed and Bakunin and his men were
expelled from the association. Bakunin had stood for violent overthrow, while
Marx believed that existing political systems should be reformed into
socialism. Compare to these lines from Larry Levis’ poem [ “At the Grave of My
Guardian Angel: St. Louis Cemetery, New Orleans”](/poem/178512): “And without
beauty, Bakunin will go on making his forlorn & unreliable little bombs in the
cold”  ,
