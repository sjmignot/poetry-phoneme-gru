# Your Mileage May Vary
## Andrew Shields

Our last night in the house was not our last.
 _With two cats in the yard_. Our movers took
the furniture in the morning. _A country where
_
they turned back time. Lifting a trunk, Dad felt
something slip in his back. _I have become
_
comfortably numb. No driving with such pain.
 _The day destroys the night_. Our real last night,
footsteps on hardwood floors. _People and friends
_
I still can recall. Sean with his singles player.
 _Dream until your dream comes true_. Dan,
an even match across the ping-pong table.
 _They're the faces of the stranger_. A girlfriend
kissed in the sunroom.  _She can take the dark
_
out of the nighttime. Too shy or young for more.
 _I'm already standing on the ground_.
Training for cross country with the other,
better runners. _Get up, get up, get out
_
of the door. A twenty-mile summer
thunderstorm. _Into this world we're thrown_.
The melancholy of second place. _I've paid
_
my dues, time after time. The dream the Red Sox
might someday win it all. _When I was young,
_
it seemed that life was so wonderful.

Leaving the morning with Dad in the back.
 _The danger on the rocks is surely past._
Big sisters with licenses. _Baby you can drive
_
my car. One last trip West. _Running into
_
the sun. Not down through the desert to Christmas
on a San Diego beach. _All the leaves
_
are brown. Not down from the Rockies to speed
across Nevada. _Like endless rain into
_
a paper cup. No stop in Medicine Bow,
highway hung on a ridge. _Mountains come
_
out of the sky. No hummingbirds surrounding
my uncle's Colorado cabin. _Come
_
with me or go alone. Instead we went
to North Dakota, then up to Winnipeg
to visit cousins. _Leave us helpless, helpless,
_
helpless. The even more endless highways
of Canada. _Get your kicks_. In Glacier,
footsteps without sound, each breath clouding
another constellation. _Open up
_
your mind and float downstream. Front-row seats
for the Red Sox in Seattle. _Sweet
_
little sixteen. A foul ball that Dad
leapt up to grab. _Joltin' Joe has left
_
and gone away. Going on to Palo Alto.
 _Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair_.
Arriving on Labor Day, Grace Slick's concert
spilling into the new backyard. _One pill
_
makes you larger, and one pill makes you small.
Our first night in the house, and not our last.
 _Johnny come lately, there's a new kid in town._
