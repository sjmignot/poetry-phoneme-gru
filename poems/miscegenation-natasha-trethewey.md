# Miscegenation
## Natasha Trethewey
In 1965 my parents broke two laws of Mississippi;
they went to Ohio to marry, returned to Mississippi.

They crossed the river into Cincinnati, a city whose name
begins with a sound like _sin_ , the sound of wrong— _mis_ in Mississippi.

A year later they moved to Canada, followed a route the same
as slaves, the train slicing the white glaze of winter, leaving Mississippi.

Faulkner’s Joe Christmas was born in winter, like Jesus, given his name
for the day he was left at the orphanage, his race unknown in Mississippi.

My father was reading _War and Peace_ when he gave me my name.
I was born near Easter, 1966, in Mississippi.

When I turned 33 my father said, _It’s your Jesus year—you’re the same_
 _age he was when he died._ It was spring, the hills green in Mississippi.

I know more than Joe Christmas did. Natasha is a Russian name—
though I’m not; it means _Christmas child_ , even in Mississippi.
