# A Whole Foods in Hawai'i
## Craig Santos Perez
I dreamed of you tonight, Wayne Kaumualii Westlake, as I walked down on the
sidewalk under plumeria trees with a vog headache looking at the Māhealani
moon.

In my need fo’ grindz, and hungry fo’ modernity, I stumbled into the
gentrified lights of Whole Foods, dreaming of your manifestos!
    What pineapples and what papayas! Busloads of tourists shopping at night!
Bulk aisle full of hippies! Millennials in the kale! Settlers in the Kona
coffee! And you, Richard Hamasaki, what were you doing kissing the ripe
mangos?

I saw you, Wayne Kaumualii Westlake, broomless, ghostly janitor, sampling the
poke in the seafood section and eyeing the smoked fish.
    I heard you ask questions of each: Who butchered the mahimahi? What price
opah belly? Are you my ‘aumakua?
    I wandered in and out of the canned goods aisle following you, and
followed in my imagination by Sir Spamalot.
    In our bourgeois fancy we strolled through the cooked foods  section
tasting hand-churned cheese, possessing every imported delicacy, and
whispering to the cashier, “Go fuck yourself.”

Where are we going, Wayne Kaumualii Westlake? The doors of perception close in
an hour. Which way does your pakalōlō point  tonight?
    (I touch your book and dream of our huaka‘i in Whole Foods and feel dādā.)
    Will we sail all night through Honolulu streets? The coconut trees no have
nuts, tarps up for the homeless, we’ll both be lonely.
    Will we cruise witnessing the ruined empire of America, past pink mopeds
in driveways, home to our overpriced apartments?
    Ah, dear uncle, Buddhahead, ghostly poetry teacher, what Hawai‘i did you
have when TheBus quit turning its wheels and you arrived in Waikīkī and stood
watching the canoes disappear on the murky waters of the Ala Wai?
