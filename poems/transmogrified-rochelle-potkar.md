He was first a snake and was in love with her—a she-snake. And then he molted
and after he molted he was a turtle and he met another she-turtle and fell in
love with her. When he deshelled after years, he became a four-legged animal,
black spots sprouting over his fur, and he fell for a leopard. He moved this
way through the jungles, the savannas, the deserts, the skies, through the
oceans, the air, the land and beneath it, changing and changing and meeting
and falling in love with new she-species.

The lovers he left behind did not change. They were who they were. The same.

They were individualistic so to speak, but now they were also heartbroken and
full of hate for him—the one who had left in the middle of, sometimes,
passionate lovemaking.

They had no idea how it was to live so many lives in one life like him.

To take no breaks with rebirths from being mosquito to man.

Sometimes evolution and progress is so fast, blessings and curses are all
mixed up, and One.
