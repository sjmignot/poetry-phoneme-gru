# The Tongue
## Tommye Blount
in my mouth is as fat as a cow’s tongue,
still I want to ask the woman
at the next table what she’s saying
into her phone. A tongue, a cow’s tongue
tastes like the rest of the cow. _Cow tastes like_

 _cow_ , an aunt once said in an accent as sweet
as Arkansas dirt. Someone, in English, told me
I don’t carry my vowels like anyone
they know. I’ve tried, but my tongue won’t move
like my aunt’s nor like anyone else’s

in my family. I ain’t makin’ sense, they’d say
if they were me. Why don’t I talk
like us anymore? Anyway ___..._ __    Every other word,
the woman slips into English. The way a train window
trades a dead city for a dead suburb;

a posh row for a cow pasture. _Duct cleaning, Thai Bistro,
_
all I can make out. I happen to love Thai Bistro,
raved about it to a friend — who’s never lived
in the city or eaten Thai food. He asked,
 _How do you know you’re not eating the tongue
_
of some endangered animal? I have the tongue
of some endangered animal. No one can understand me

anymore. I’m the animal on my plate
that eventually mumbles in my stomach. _Speak up!
_
What are you saying?! I shout to the woman
with my inside voice. Oh well ___..._ __    A tongue
is a tongue is a tongue. I bet

the woman is talking about the weather;
or what she needs to pick up from the store;
or what to get __ for __’s birthday;
or __ said __ is coming to __ ;
or __ __ __ __ .
