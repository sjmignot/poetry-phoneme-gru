# Elegy
## Jaswinder Bolina
In sun the sunburned skin sloughs off the sunburned shoulder.
Most folks believe this is the body’s slow mend.

Most folks believe in the good yolk of the soul.

I believe in autopsy lingo _of natural causes_ should be replaced
with _of long-term exposure to the dim, unwavering radiation of the morning
star._

The evening they burn your body,
I step into the garden and arrange a crooked line of birdbaths to skip stones
across

until a bell tower tolls its eight arguments against daylight
and the skyline illuminates, ragged and unmended

like a poem turned on its side.

The evening they burn your body,
I believe I’ll step into the living room and be greeted by you

or by someone who could play you in a movie.

The curtains are an aurora of earthly proportion.
You don’t exist.

A flash igniting the paned glass is the silent lightning outrunning its noise.
You’re on fire.
