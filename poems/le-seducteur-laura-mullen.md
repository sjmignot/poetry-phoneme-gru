Doesn’t that shining line
Of ocean, broken
Suggest a ship at sea,
Or something? Ah, if to be
“At sea” is to be lost,
Left out, or just un-
Certain of the meaning,
Someone else chimes in.
Nevermind, I’m sure it’s
Nothing, someone else insists
Of this impossible vessel —
Crafted of affect and lack
Of glasses, the sail a conceit
Of low clouds, the bow
A row of breakers, sun
Glinting off the port-
Hole (imagined) of the cabin
Below whose bed is also,
As we say, the sea-
 _Bed_ or  _floor_ (as if it were
A dwelling down there,
Where the restless sleepers
Are scattered bone). A ship
At sea is only a figure
Of speech somebody else
Claims: a quick shape —
Suggested by the passage
Of a cloud and the tug
Of  the current; a thin dream
Already almost forgotten ...
If you can forget the cargo,
Another adds, which was
Human: though that fact
Was somehow less visible
To the traders than the trade
Routes traced out across
The dissolving paper
Map, under a spill of silver
Coins poured out. Life
Is brief, one might sigh
At this point: a matter
Of water in water
Moving, each of us
Carefully bearing
The bags we packed
With cherished flotsam
And jetsam, clutching
A one-way ticket
Printed on a spume
Of wind-blown white ...
A pretty image, used
To excuse too much:
As if the lives enslaved
Were worthless as this
Sudden welling up
Of what is mostly self-
Pity (salt at my lips,
You say, my vision
Swimming). Nothing.
It’s nothing but ...
It’s nothing. To be
 _At sea_ is also to be,
As we say, astray or
In the dark, hoping
For _terra firma_ , and
To be enlightened,
Soon, as to just what
Was meant by that sad
Laugh and last remark.
