# Conversations with the Artist (1)
## Rebecca Morgan Frank
I’ve always felt as if I were in a cage.
If I stick out an arm, I’m seen as wanting
and taking. A leg: my violence is noted.
When I mentioned the suffocation by
my father, they made it autobiographical.
The subtext of my work in iron has been
ignored, lost in discussions of time, not space.
What you’ll never understand about
installations is that everyone else is always
outside of them. I’m stuck inside. The move
toward deliberate transience is the mark of a fool.
If disappearing is inevitable, you must fight it.
No one misses the prisoner.
The bars are like a frame: you want in
as much as I have always wanted out.
