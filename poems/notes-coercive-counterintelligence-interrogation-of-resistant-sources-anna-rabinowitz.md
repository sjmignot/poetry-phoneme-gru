# Notes: Coercive Counterintelligence Interrogation of Resistant Sources
## Anna Rabinowitz
HOW TO SUCCEED IN TORTURE
WITHOUT REALLY TRYING

1\. FIRST THINGS FIRST:

Surprise,
            catch your source off balance
            when he least expects it:
At the moment he opens his eyes in the morning
While he shits on the can.

Detain and confine,

                      quickly,
      quickly

            ​cut him off from the known.

Plunge your source into the strange,

                      the invisible wells gone dry in his bones
Drained by his eyes

         He’s in occupied territory—

            he could walk a long time and find nowhere, nothing, nada

                  no doors, no tunnels, windows

2\. KEEP IT SIMPLE:

      Familiar clothing reinforces identity.

       Replace the source’s attire with items several sizes too large.

       Shave off his hair.

       Confiscate his belt; make him hold up his pants.

        Best of all, keep him naked, especially from the waist down.

3\. YOUR GOALS:

        Identify, expose and exploit the resistant source’s internal
           hungers.

        Induce the source to fluctuate inside himself.

        Befuddle the source’s anxiety with constant, sudden
        disruptions of patterns, blurs and howling winds.

        Make sure the source’s body is havoc and there is no escape.

        Play the role of superior external/paternal power geared to
        crush the source’s will and extract a true confession.

 _NOTA BENE: the interrogator, by virtue of his role as the sole
_
        donor of satisfaction and punishment, may take on the stature
        and importance of a father figure—the one the source loves but
        hates and wants to castrate. Intense hatred and warm feelings
       often make faithful friends.

4\. REGRESSION AS RORSCHACH:

When the binding ropes are released and
 the course is dropped one foot,

 then another foot, then again,
 and so on and so on,

 the rhythm of elevation, descent, known as “squassation”,
 reach its climax when the source’s torso

 lands in the fetal pose.

5\. MIND YOUR P’s and Q’s:

        Full-blown DDD (depression, debility, dread) syndrome
        constitutes a state of discomfort that is well nigh intolerable.

        The source sinks into defensive apathy from which it is hard
        to arouse him.

        Marshal your quick wit, good judgment and perfect timing
        to prevent such collapse.

6\. THE BEAUTY OF ISOLATION:

        A cell that is soundproof, odorless, and totally dark can
        produce results in a few hours or days, while detention in
        an ordinary cell may produce only after weeks or
       months of confinement.

       Speedy onset of anxiety is of great benefit to you in fulfilling
       your mission.

        Finally, bear in mind a water tank or iron lung is more
        effective than a cell.

7\. DURESS, COMPLIANCE, REGRESSION
ARE THE HOLY TRINITY OF COERCIVE
INTERROGATION:

        You **** are in the service of your country.

        You are helping to make the world a better place.
