# I Am Chito
## Hiromi Itō
The first time I ever heard about coyotes
Was in a book called (in Japanese) _Seton’s Animals for Boys and Girls_
There I encountered Lobo the Wolf King, bighorn sheep, a family of wild boars,
cottontail rabbits, and raccoons, but it was the stories of the wise coyote I
loved the best
I read the book over and over, over and over, it taught me the wisdom of
rabbits, wolves, wild boars, but nothing surpassed the wisdom of the coyote
Tito was raised by humans, was kept constantly on a leash
No one loved her, they teased her until she ran away
She learned to survive
Ran for her life with her pups in her mouth
Trying to get away from dogs and people
I read about her over and over, over and over
There was a map of America in the front of the book with pictures of animals
where the stories took place: coyotes in the central plains, wolves in the
southwest and north, elsewhere there were cottontails, boars, and partridges
During my childhood, that was America to me
Where did that book go? I no longer live in my childhood home, not even in the
same town, not even in the same country, I lost my place there, I lost people
and relationships, almost lost others too, I lost my language, but what about
that book I read over and over, over and over? I must have lost it too

Just the other day
I tried searching for it on Amazon
It popped right up, and I ordered it straight away
 _Lives of the Hunted_ it’s called in English
Published in 1901, reprinted in 1967
It arrived at my home
A former library copy, the word discard stamped on it in big letters, probably
the library didn’t want it because the stories are too cruel, too cruel for
today’s youth, nowadays kids are used to killing one another in the virtual
world, but even so, the stories are too cruel,  a mother coyote was giving her
cubs her milk, was licking them when hunters shot her dead, her cubs fled into
their den, only to be dragged out one by one
Here is how the book describes it:
 _Even at this age there was a certain individuality of character among the
puppies. Some of them squealed and some of them growled when dragged out to
die. One or two tried to bite. The one that had been slowest to comprehend the
danger, had been the last to retreat, and so was on top of the pile, and
therefore the first killed. The one that had first realized the peril had
retreated first, and now crouched at the bottom of the pile. Coolly and
remorselessly the others were killed one by one, and then this prudent little
puppy was seen to be the last of the family. It lay perfectly still, even when
touched, its eyes being half closed, as, guided by instinct, it tried to “play
possum.” One of the men picked it up. It neither squealed nor resisted._
Neither squealed
Nor resisted ...
The book was in English, but I could read it quickly
Since I remembered the Japanese
I had read the book over and over, over and over
All the coyote pups were killed
Only one survived, only a single pup
Tossed with its dead littermates into a sack and taken to a farm
In the original, the hunters named her _Tito_
That’s what I had suspected, I had read it in an old translation, kids in
Japan back then couldn’t be expected to pronounce the unfamiliar sound _ti_ ,
but that’s the version I was brought up on
So for me, her name was always _Chito_
I was always _Chito_

 _Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-w-o-o-o-o-o-o-w_
I remember her voice
When I was a child, I read the book over and over, over and over
Here is how the book describes it:
 _an inborn hankering to sing_
Her songs were
 _a volley of short barks
mixed with doleful squalls —
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-w-o-o-o-o-o-o-w_
Here is how the book describes it:
 _when the sun went down she would feel the impulse to sing that wild song of
the West which means so much to the Coyotes. It is not the invention of an
individual nor of the present, but was slowly built out of the feelings of all
Coyotes in all ages._
I’m not sure if I remember the Japanese correctly
Getting old is no fun at all, you forget important things like that
 _It is not the invention of an individual nor of the present,
but was slowly built out of the feelings of all Coyotes in all ages_ and
Her experiences _all emphasized for her that old idea to “lay low”—
that is, to be quiet, unobtrusive, and hide when danger is in sight_
Those were the most important things I learned as a child
Chito’s wisdom
How to survive
Seeing the book, I remembered why
I came to this place called America
The most important things I learned as a child
Were in that book I read over and over
Maybe I had lost them for a while
Or just forgotten
The fate of the animals, their lives and deaths
Their lives upon the plains, and my life too
Chito was killed over and over again
But each time she came back to life
The humans tenaciously, persistently killed her
She tricked them and was tricked by them in return
She scattered her feces, went into heat
The more they hunted her
The more clearly things came into focus
In other words, all the things she thought along the way
Not the invention of an individual nor of the present
But slowly built out of the feelings of all coyotes in all ages
It was for Chito
For Chito
That I abandoned my home, bought an airline ticket
And came to this place
There was someone I barely knew, I’d only barely caught his scent
But still I followed my nose and pursued him
I found a room, rented a car
And stayed the full three months permitted without a visa, I thought I’d try
to stay
When people asked me why I’d come, I said
I’m a poet, I’ve come to learn about the oral traditions of the Native
Americans
And that was true
But I didn’t even know what I wanted to know
I didn’t know where to go
I didn’t know whom to ask
I was terrible at speaking with people in my native tongue, so in English it
was damn near impossible, I couldn’t even tell them who I am (it took me
decades to say that even in Japanese)
But the real reason I came
Was because I wanted to encounter a coyote
I wanted to prick up my ears and listen to its howl
Rattling dryly over the roads, through the darkness of night
