# Decrescence
## Yanyi
The Queen sits on a throne
of gem-trimmed robes.

Between her robes
the jutted moth, it follows

dust. She can’t rest before
the funeral, her self-

unmaking, some maid
whose hair is browned

by blood; a matching
queen. Nights’ dim candles,

grackles’ glib decrescence.
 _Now dance, now weep._

No rest for feet still
warm from summer’s

phrasing — odors / ankle
/ thorn. Keeping time

while dying, the Queen grows
bored, her hand’s throat

out, amiss. (Yet I sob,
I paw. Yet) I kiss.
