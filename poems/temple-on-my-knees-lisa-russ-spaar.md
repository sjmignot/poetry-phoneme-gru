# Temple On My Knees
## Lisa Russ Spaar
When this day returns to me
I will value your heart,
long hurt in long division,
over mine. Mouth above mine too —
 _say you love me_ , truth never more
meant, _say you are angry_.
Words, words we net with our mouths.
Soul is an old thirst but not as first
as the body’s perhaps,
though on bad nights its melancholy
eats us out, to a person.
True, time is undigressing.
Yet true is all we can be:
rhyming you, rhyming me.
