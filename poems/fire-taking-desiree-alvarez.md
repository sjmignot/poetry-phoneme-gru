# Fire-Taking
## Desirée Alvarez
                                              Aztec girl twisting her hair
into a braid
                                              when the army arrives.
She sees them in her citadel,

her nickname for the city
                                              forgotten by her mouth’s mind.

The Spanish writer who keeps the oldest codex saw grief

when the papers of the people’s prayers were burned by the soldiers.

Havoc, my freedom, without a history I invent my own.

Say I am of many faces,
neither white nor brown,
say violet,

                             the color that speaks like violence.

Legacy sounds like lost at sea.

              Say it wasn’t precious to me, identity.
              Strange, dangerous innocence.
              The earth is an onion strung with lights, my eyes sting
from the blaze.
A gold hawk joins

              the ring of fox in heavy dew around me early and I
am part of their wet ritual in my wish

                                                            to turn from what
is human, even

knowing it was hawk who stole the woodpecker’s redheaded flight.
