# Painted Ladies
## James K. Zimmerman
the day after you sighed
              your last breath out
we let your butterflies go

your painted ladies

four of them born
              from paper wombs
              into a cheesecloth cage

now proudly decked out
              in orange and white
              trimmed in black

we let them go
              with stiffened fingers

they would not leave

one drifted in hovering
              half-hearted circles
another rested softly on your
              daughter's wet shoulder
a third held close to the budding
              milkweed you saved
              from the scythe years ago
the last one content to say
              perched in its velvet cape
              on my sunlit finger

we could not speak
so still
              the afternoon

and when time began
              once again to flow
they knew it was for them
              (the opening of our hands)

another ragged breath was drawn
as they pumped and sputtered
              (a single voice)
and took to the clouding sky
