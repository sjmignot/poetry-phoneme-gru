When it became my turn to speak
all that my tongue produced was dust.
I hold my cat to this. I wear finery.



_in moments of clarity there is no grace
_

 _it sits into the jar, the kitten, we pace_



As I watched the saplings become trees
I found a song my father sung, in my mouth.
No words, just melody. I am unuttered.



_on black and white film we are dressed in a shadow of lace
_

_it sits into the jar, the kitten, we pace_



I hold my cat still, as he becomes. The names
of ships that sank on their maiden voyages
are not its. I shall name him Castro.



_among the flotsam were documents the sea-air could not erase
_
_it sits into the jar, the kitten, we pace_



If it becomes like it was, is, ever shall
I will partake in blood-lettings to appease
the vengeful sky-god. I am deep ecology.



_our feet wet in the sand at night, there was a lantern we would always chase_
 _it sits into the jar, the kitten, we pace_



When my memory becomes, like my tongue,
dust, effluvial, sunken, and pure melody,
please, on sand, draw the _Batavia_ for me.



_with your hands remember the contours of my aging face
_
_we slip into the light, your fingers, they lace_
