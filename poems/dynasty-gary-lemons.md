# Dynasty
## Gary Lemons
I talk to the orchids on my kitchen
Counter most days—ask forgiveness of them—
Understand they are lost and far from home
And alone in alien soil with smells
Of meat in their stamens and dogs barking
And timers going off—I do my best
To make my world a jungle where they grow
Their pale flowers and die warm in the steam
Coming off kettles and dinner plates.

I can’t look at anything anymore
Without seeing the bones under the skin—
The lips of the ventriloquist moving—

The hunger in everything wants out—
Held hostage to the coming bite—
I place the fallen brown petals in the unmarked
Grave of my poem where no one can disturb
The mad flowers of the exiled king.
