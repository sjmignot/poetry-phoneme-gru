# everything i've called women
## Nate Marshall
if i said baby you might think a certain thing but nah.
that’s only maybe what i mean, perhaps i’ll say ma

& your mind says Cam’ron, women creeping up
but i’m a changed man, & that’s not game ma.

it’s practice in high school & THOT isn’t out yet.
we’re classic Chicago & bustdowns bloom in our mouths. my Ma

spits Too $hort & the line i catch the first time
is _b*tch b*tch b*tch make me rich_ but Ma

puts me on punishment when i whisper Ludacris
& tells me sex shouldn’t hurt. i say nothing & Ma

lets it go until a few years later when i get becky
or brain or top or dome by a white girl & Ma

tells me everything i’ve risked for this escapade.
i can’t fix my mouth to say                      _but Ma
_

what i got i didn’t ask for. shorty just kinda went
& i was supposed to moan street things like _hey ma
_

you look beautiful.  & after that i moan it all
& give women a rash of nicknames there’s ma

(who calls me pa) & hollywood & princess & pop star
& doctor & lady & knee socks &                           _ma_

 _what’s your name i just put where we met in my phone
_
don’t be mad i remember our whole convo ma

& bae & baby & honey & shorty & poison & tenderoni
& when i’m lonely hey stranger. how you been ma?

& sometimes i’ve called & gotten dial tone songs
or been told Nate do you remember my name? or is that why you say ma?
