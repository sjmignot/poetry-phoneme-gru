# The Hermit: 75
## Lucy Ives
75.


Even with geographic proximity, there may exist temporal
systems such that two people cannot meet one another or will
never meet again.



Dream last night includes swimming. Something about a thick
river, keep riding boats on it, travel from station to station,
temporary home to home. It is Berlin or a group of islands
called "Connecticut." I am alone or have a child or am with
my brother. It is sunset, when one seeks something.



It is possible we somehow die for a time, a year, a month, a day,
without realizing this, then awake to find ourselves, which is to
say "someone," present again, attentive, expectant, apologetic
even?
