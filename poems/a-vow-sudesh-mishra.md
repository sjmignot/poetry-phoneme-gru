# A Vow
## Sudesh Mishra
I pledge to sit upright in my coffin
as soon as the morgue-ice melts, and turn
a cheek grayer than this dusk. Kiss it
even if it doesn’t remind you of yesterday,
but let your tact disregard the breath
of a corpse mingled with the musk
you emptied on my breast. The belched outrage
from a belly domed in gas is simply
my way of saying, “Honey, I’m home.”
The carrion fly counting the fibers
in my nose is no heavenly harbinger.
Discount it as you’d discount a bird
on a cliché and fear nothing for there’s nothing
left to fear. Darling, I’m in no hurry.
Take your time in bringing me a rose
of that pinot we once praised to the sky
and let my tongue gad about in a warm
crimson bay. I swear to lie back forever
when the stylus roundly vexes a scratch
in our nuptial song, and it all begins again.
