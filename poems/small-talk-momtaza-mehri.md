# Small Talk
## Momtaza Mehri
you michelangelo’s crouching boy/you d’angelo’s purr/you dead currency/you
dead presidents/you a stick of incense/you a stick-up artist/you haraami/you
the hum of a lifetime basined in my lap/count our tallies of loss backward for
me/run to the bank & translate it into a fistful of green of your choice/or
something else sanctified/or european/pick the synonym of your choice.

in a traditional sense/the body holds its arithmetic/exports it outward/to the
touch and exhale/the praxis felt best/against a groan of concrete/with the
dumb weight of a hand against the small of a back/here, an elevator is our
only spiritual ascension/can i be excused from living so slimly?

i dream you closer too/beside the honey-colored dog licking its vulva/an
abstract laugh swelling inside your throat/ask me about blood clots and spun
coins/the cracked skin of heels/anything but the nightly heartbreaks of/too
many addresses/and all the ways/i am still auditioning/for this country’s
approval.
