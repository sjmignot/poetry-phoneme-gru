# all nearness pauses, while a star can grow

### 1948

all nearness pauses, while a star can grow

all distance breathes a final dream of bells;
perfectly outlined against afterglow
are all amzing the and peaceful hills

(not where not here but neither’s blue most both)

And history immeasurably is
Wealthier by a single sweet day’s death:
As not imagined secrecies comprise

goldenly huge whole the upfloating moon.

Time’s a strage fellow;
			 More he gives than takes
(and he takes all) nor any marvel finds
quite disappearance but some keener makes
losing, gaining
		—love! If a world ends

more than all worlds begin to (see?) begin
