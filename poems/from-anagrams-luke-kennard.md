## Luke Kennard
And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know
not: Am I my brother’s keeper? And He said, What hast thou done? The voice of
thy brother’s blood crieth unto Me from the ground. And now art thou cursed
from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood
from thy hand. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.


Genesis 4:9–12
