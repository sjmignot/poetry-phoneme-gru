# Dan Emmett Writes "Dixie," 1859
## Rachel Richardson
He started with the tune his mother had hummed
in Ohio, nostalgia he’d carried for years,
and by Sunday afternoon he had the words.
A triumph, already; he whistled the banjo’s part.

(Himself a sympathizer from the North,
called _copperhead,_ called traitor by his own kin.)

Something lively, some _git-up-and-git_ they’d wanted
and didn’t he deliver—
Miss Susan got seven encores the first night.
That gave them their tune, their Negro walk-around—

 _Look away, look away, look away,_ they sang.
Vipers, that spring, spread thick on the ground.
