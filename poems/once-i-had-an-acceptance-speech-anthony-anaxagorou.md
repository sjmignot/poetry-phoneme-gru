# Once I Had an Acceptance Speech
## Anthony Anaxagorou
Driving too close to the curb. Admit
to being poor. Stash pumpkin seeds
for my kid. Hustle the Christian way.
Starch my shirt collars. Value a strong
smudge. Give pigeons saintly names.
Cream both my feet. Recycle. Sign off
emails with warm regards. Double tap
#vegan. Heart statuses which start with
 _I’m delighted to announce._ Mornings.
I struggle to decide what mood to wear.
Evenings. I lie beside my aftershaves
imagining the sea. I should really have
it by now. A Dyson. Panasonic bread
maker. A photo by the piano of a slum
tour. I need the spirit of a full-moon party
rather than the charisma of a shed. They
honk when I slow. I swear with my eyes.
Think of real blood. Sunday comes. Dad
asks what’s the plan. I knit him the only
winning scratch card. I leave a candle on
for destiny. Once. I had an acceptance
speech written. Soon. A staircase will rise
to defeat us all. The roads have moved.
When I get in I’ll sit in the shower  & say
it’s a bath. Double tap an ultrasound pic.
Sip railroad water. Notification. ZANC1
started following you. Check my speed.
Slap on another Barry Manilow playlist.
Keep my grays in the dashboard. Wonder.
What the guy who put a gun to my little
brother’s head is doing for New Year’s.
Wonder. If my neighbor made it through.
Up ahead. A badger’s hit beside a boulder.
Its glare a wooden egg I slow for.
