## Atsuro Riley
Daddy goes.
         Trolling and trawling and crawfishing and crabbing and bass-boating
and trestle-jumping bare into rust-brackish water and cane-poling for bream
and shallow-gigging too with a nail-pointy broomstick and creek-shrimping and
cooler-dragging and coon-chasing and dove-dogging and duck-bagging and
squirrel-tailing and tail-hankering and hard-cranking and -shifting and
backfiring like a gun in his _tittie-tan_ El Camino and parking it at The
House of Ham and Dawn's Busy Hands and Betty's pink house and Mrs. Sweatman's
brick house and Linda's dock-facing double-wide and spine-leaning Vicki
against her _WIDE-GLIDE_ Pontiac and pumping for pay at Ray Wade's Esso and
snuff-dipping and plug-sucking and tar-weeping pore-wise and LuckyStrike-
smoking and Kool only sometimes and penny-pitching and dog-racing and bet-
losing _cocksuckmotherfuck_ and pool-shooting and bottle-shooting over behind
Tas-T-O's Donuts and _shootin' the shit_ and _chewin' the fat_ and _just
jawin' who asked you_ and blank-blinking quick back at me and _whose young are
you no-how_ and hounddog-digging buried half-pints from the woods.
