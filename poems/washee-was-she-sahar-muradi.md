# washee/was she
## Sahar Muradi
she was _washee_ i told her you are
like your motherland a wilderness
needs a belt laid down two white
hotel towels took her into the tub to
 _wudu_ the boys out of her mouth pointed
her nipples toward _qibla_ wiped clean
her intention to perform _ruk’u_ as if
carrying a glass of _chai_ on her back
fold at the knees palms to the ground
tucked her soles under her _astaghfirullah_
used country
in my used country I felt his teeth
circle as a mosquito the black mystery
he placed my _right_ hand over my wrong
stain said he was bringing me _home_
offered me a suite with a lock a key in
the shape of a _brother_ perhaps twenty-
two years old my body _pure_ as a glass
table he spilled _was she_ my boss on my
back at night came easy as a fly
to post-conflict  _faithfully_
used my country
