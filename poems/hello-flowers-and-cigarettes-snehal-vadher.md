# Hello flowers and cigarettes

Hello flowers and cigarettes
every afternoon spoke to a bird
a small set of hands
they gone out in the pond and slept
who seem to be doing something nicely
which made them drowsy
only to grace and share the beautiful moments
across Latin streets
Hello flowers and cigarettes
cordially invited
into an employment contract
and at last there were too many
