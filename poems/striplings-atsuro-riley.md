# Striplings
## Atsuro Riley
                                                      1. FIELD


Truck a passel (a poke) of wildling boys

_We call ourselves (our pack) the orphan-slaves
_


Upcountry — loosed from mothers

_Farmed out for scratch by mamas
_


Pale (pink-backed) tobacco-crew

_Bossed by peeled-stick (breakback) donkey-switch
_


Tarred cropper-force

_Forced cropper-line
_
Right far afield past Social Knob

_Dark welty field near Luris
_


                                      2. BUNKHOUSE

Most nights the boy they called Tynan
suppered us with scrapple from a can. Or some black-eyes
he’d’ve road-begged; a quarter-peck of crowders
scrounged off vines.


The broad back-skin on the tallest boy
   —a (spreading) welt-weave, a lattice.


Last good gloam-minute after work
we’d strip off there in the side-yard, yawping; taking turns
de-tarring      un-burning
arc-aiming cool hose-spray each on each.


Eleven of us /  _chigger-scritches_ , _scablets_.
Eleven of us /  _none of us clean._


Where the boss of us bore down
on us — our rank of   bedrolls on the floorboards — one and
one and one, _eleven of us_ — ranked sack-beds
on floorboards — boots of — black breath of — the boss


of us bearing down on us —  _ain’t none_
_of us (not a one of us) clean.

                                        3. AFTER-ROAD

           And so (the heaving) boys got trucked to _CANDY'S STOP_
up Hwy. 52 one night and dumped.
