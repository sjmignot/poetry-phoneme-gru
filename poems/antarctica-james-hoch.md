# Antarctica
## James Hoch
Like nights we knelt on the dirt floor
of a dugout, leaned our heads back,
eyes twitching gone, and popped nitrous

canisters into the communion shapes
of our mouths, slipped inside where
everything seemed to be falling snow,

ice, the time split between chasing flies
through a darkened park and sprawling
in sycamore bark—how clean that abyss

we drifted in, like dew, more like pollen,
on our skins; and, beneath, a want
for touch, a kiss, a return. Like nothing

back then, to break an arm latching on
to the bumper of an Impala, or settling back
as the car took us as far as the salted bridge,

before letting the ride go with a mitten
caught behind the chrome waving
from the other side of the river.  _Like this_ ,

you said, sliding a needle, watching
dope plunge, the body's rush and tow
until you felt something like an angel

hovering above, but it was only pigeon
feathers deviling the air. Those friends
are gone: some dead, dying, locked up

or jailed in themselves; and when I see
some kids running in the heat of a taillight
swirling behind them, I remember we

wanted only to quiet our bodies, their
unnatural hum, a vague pull inward,
some thin furrows gliding over the snow.
