# Sestina in Prose
## Katharine Coles
It was like climbing a mountain to those of us who’d climbed one. To the
others, it was like, I suppose, something else. In other words, we let
everybody find her own figure of speech.

Not that it—speech—lay thick on the ground, or mountain; it presented itself
one word at a time, far between. A body had to keep an eye out, like for
firewood at dusk, or else

miss her chance. Nobody else, let’s face it, cared about metaphor, or even
simile, the like-it-or-not-ness of the mountain pretty much getting  between a
body and her musing, in its going. One

step at a time, anyone could lose herself or someone else just staring at her
feet. And _if a body meet a body_ is not mere speech but something that could
happen, like hopping a bus—though on the mountain

you’ll catch no rides, worse luck, the mountain requires to be climbed on
foot, one after the other, nothing else will get you up it. There’s nothing
like such obduracy but in the wild, nobody can tell you otherwise. No simple
figure,

this struggle: just a crag, your burden, and your own two feet. Say
otherwise, talk through your hat, which I don’t care for.
