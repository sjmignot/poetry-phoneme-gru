# Travels of Marco
## Mark Levine
I was in Asia Minor
in pursuit of distant honor
in a suit of finest armor
in a forest of pine or
planks. I was not lost. Regina
(my sextant) stared into the refiner’s
flare as evening grew maligner.

            I was in Kazakhstan
            collecting rarest poppies. My capstan
            gave out. I could no more withstand
            the tides than fall to the rattan
            mat like Tristan
            sailing emptily to his mutant
            island.

                        I was in greater Ghana
                        harvesting marijuana
                        with soul-strafing Tatiana,
                        the local swan—a
                        mortal one, a
                        prize among the fauna.
                        (There should have been a lawn a-

                                    gainst her.) You see, I was in Corinth
                                    fabricating synth-
                                    etic absinthe.
                                    I was adamant. The
                                    trophy I chased for the ninth
                                    night of days was Cynth
                                    -ia, succumbing at the plinth.

                        Then to Argentina
                        I set forth with Ekaterina
                        a diminishing ballerina.
                        She pled for fina-
                        steride, having seen a
                        parrot turn bright green u-
                        pon my mythic ocarina.

            I was in Tel Aviv.
            Viv-
            ian (my pigeon) and I were feve
            -rish from bouts of griev-
            ous liv-
            er malaise. We must have been naive
            -r than a hibernal beave

-r, for soon I was in Canada
as ever. Had no plan; not a
home to hide in, nothing human. Ada
(vulgar bird) went wan, bade a
screeching goodnight to her one God, a
soapstone strap-on. Alone, I ran a do-
zen tests: None truer, none sadder.
