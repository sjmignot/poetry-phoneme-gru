# All the American Poets Have Titled Their New Books "The End"
## Cornelius Eady
How many books now have the word _Last_
In their title? Or _worry_ , or some dangling variation
Of mistake? Or _empire burning_ , or
 _The fools have fucked it up?_

Who the hell listens? They roar and
Wriggle, up and down the page,
They screen-print what’s coming next — pinups
Of blocked streets and stone faces.

How many books sling the word _doom_ ,
Or mimic spotlights or air raid sirens,
Regurgitate the Romans, the Kick Down the
Door Guys, our genius with the fiery furnace?

The quivers, the shakes, the iambic dread,
The anger, the insomnia, the slow tic
Of the wait, the wail, the transcribed _too late_ ,
In the manner of those who have gone before us,
Geiger counters, clacking the rising damp.
