# Explaining Villanelles to an Alien
## Anthony Lawrence
With “Waltzing Matilda,” funnel web spiders, and echidnas out of the way, you
move on to the villanelle. The alien learns quickly, and soon the rhyme scheme
and refrain are being applied to whatever it encounters: moonlight filling a
green bucket by the door, a dog’s tooth in furniture, the sound of a nail gun.
You go to bed and dream of planets disappearing like balls in a perfect
snooker clearance. In the morning you find the walls papered with villanelles,
each one signed by what appears to be a bar code. When you scan one with your
phone, the screen lights up with footage of a satellite flyby through the
heliosphere, trailing the sound of whale song, children crying, sustained
applause, and Blind Willie Johnson’s “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the
Ground.”
