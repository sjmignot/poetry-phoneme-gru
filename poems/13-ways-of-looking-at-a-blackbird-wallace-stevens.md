# 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird
## Wallace Stevens
### 1954

**I**
Among twenty snowy mountains,g
The only moving thingg
Was the eye of the blackbird.g

**II**
I was of three minds,g
Like a treeg
In which there are three blackbirds.g

**III**
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.g
It was a small part of the pantomime.g

**IV**
A man and a womang
Are one.g
A man and a woman and a blackbirdg
Are one.g

**V**
I do not know which to prefer,g
The beauty of inflectionsg
Or the beauty of innuendoes,g
The blackbird whistlingg
Or just after.g

**VI**
Icicles filled the long windowg
With barbaric glass.g
The shadow of the blackbirdg
Crossed it, to and fro.g
The moodg
Traced in the shadowg
An indecipherable cause.g

**VII**
O thin men of Haddam,g
Why do you imagine golden birds?g
Do you not see how the blackbirdg
Walks around the feetg
Of the women about you?g

**VIII**
I know noble accentsg
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;g
But I know, too,g
That the blackbird is involvedg
In what I know.g

**IX**
When the blackbird flew out of sight,g
It marked the edgeg
Of one of many circles.g

**X**
At the sight of blackbirdsg
Flying in a green light,g
Even the bawds of euphonyg
Would cry out sharply.g

**XI**
He rode over Connecticutg
In a glass coach.g
Once, a fear pierced him,g
In that he mistookg
The shadow of his equipageg
For blackbirds.g

**XII**
The river is moving.g
The blackbird must be flying.g

**XIII**
It was evening all afternoon.g
It was snowingg
And it was going to snow.g
The blackbird satg
In the cedar-limbs.
