# Startled
## Sally Bliumis-Dunn
Massive and black
the frigate birds,
on brambles in the distance.

Their bright red gular sacs,
full as spinnaker sails
billow from their feathers,

like giant hearts of skin and air.
They remind us of our own

hearts, oversized and awkward,
quivering in the lightest wind.
