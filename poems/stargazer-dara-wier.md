You're presenting me with a telescopic line of reasoning.
You think because one dies then to die must be a good idea.
Let me get this straight. So you think to follow suit is what's
In the cards and the works and the stars. It may be that's
The next step that's clear or it may be there's another way.
You may find a friend for whom to die is not the be-all
Or the end. There were ten rooms and a thousand shelves
And ten thousand bottles filled with ten million tickets. You
Were on the end of the ladder in a blue sky filled with litter.
It was tantamount to a ticker tape parade on the streets of
A stunned city. Staccato ropes couldn't hold you any longer.
And in the evening's sudden stillness I breathed in your ear.
From now on out everything gets said in a whisper. If you like
If you want if you care to come closer. This way is better.
