# The Reason
## Stevie Smith
My life is vile
         I hate it so
         I’ll wait awhile
         And then I’ll go.

         Why wait at all?
         Hope springs alive,
         Good may befall
         I yet may thrive.

It is because I can’t make up my mind
If God is good, impotent or unkind.
