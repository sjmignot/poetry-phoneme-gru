# Antiphons of the Known World
## Luke Davies
For Daniel Morden
Athena, coming onto me (verbatim transcription):
 _Every step you take will be the right one._

Women encouraged me like that:
 _Avoiding void, no one goes nameless in this world._

Power? I was the son of a king:
 _Hacking the armor from the limbs of the dying._

In the path of the blade of the plough I met God my foe:
 _Oh blight his voyage with trial and calamity._

All he needed was a taste of his own medicine:
 _The water was white with the blades of our oars._

Long-limbed Circe, the troubled, could only bring trouble:
 _Sure enough that month became a year._

Then Demodocus struck his lyre, and sang for me:
 _In that soft song I led one hundred lives._

I was young, singing such distance, when I set out:
 _The meters were my cloak, my map, my axe._

Declensions of the beasts defined my travels:
 _I made the lions purr; the lions licked my hands._

When gulls cry over rough water, home is close:
 _I remembered Charybdis the Swallower, in her magnificence._

Horizon-soaked, I sat and sobbed. Sunset. Shoulders shaking.
 _This was the liver’s dying, the world’s waking._
