# The Floor Is Yours
## Fady Joudah
My chicken pox hotel
your machine gun pointillism

My bamboo branch severed but nimble name
in the air of two alphabets
Picassos in bull-light routine

Your mantis welded on a pole
with a spiral staircase
my romance between pillager and villager

timed & timely intensity
inversely proportional to frequency

the chickadees in my voice
the thrush in your mouth

our polymers of I skipping
their archipelago stones

Your touchscreen
my ringtone heart

Your mahogany gift bag
puffed with confetti

my songs to appear as gauze
for a new island
