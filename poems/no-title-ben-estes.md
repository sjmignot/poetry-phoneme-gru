That this mountainside looks like a face is accidental,
which is a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.
The touch-smoothed redwood cross-section, in its rings
of growth and brightness,
seems like a sun seen from underwater,
wobbly as jelly, mocking my
inability to find a job, my food stamps,
and saddens me to see
the teens tagging themselves in nearby places
to earn a virtual friend's respect, or boasting
other symptoms of youth while leaving
their greasy fingerprints on the thick lenses of my glasses,
mocking my desire for artwork
to remain packed in straw, and in music
for sleepers halfway awake to grow wild in.

It all gives me faith in arranging, I guess,
when there is nothing else I seem much good at but fuss
and copy and paste, with a head full of so many other worries.
Got a check today. Bought a book I can't read
without it putting me to sleep
with its out-of-date luxuriousness.

So instead of reading it,
I stayed up and listened to Harry Partch's song
 _And on the Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma_ ,
dedicating it to the memory of Ramon Novarro,
hoping it would arch electrically above him
with all the characteristics of fire
all night,
all day,
and soak his early spring colors in a late autumn
sun as pale as silver and fern-green skies

 _to draw light
_
through midnight

and steer instead his valley's vista
toward my own simple neighborhood loneliness
with nothing better to do than lie back and lecture
those cultured Internet boys
on their own death's primitive and permanent cartoons,
to walk carefully and not step on any snails,
the poor,
the rough skin bundles,
or shiny boners poking out from satin robes.
This light, is dark.
And on the seventh day petals fell on Petaluma,
forgiving those who hurried past before
stuffed with poo and feathers underneath the hot yellow heat
that I wish would ignite all the unopened envelopes
piling up on the table by my front door,
(and burn up all of the time I've spent
on all of the things I can't
put my finger toward).

I went for a walk this evening
and found a speckled turkey egg
where the river settled
into the mud of the salt flats.
I looked at the burnished iris
of the eye of a trout.
A gleaming Atlantic coin.
Thinking even the wind tonight could speak,
blowing in seeds not yet caught
on the coat of the dog. Still, life.
And all the needs in this world.
