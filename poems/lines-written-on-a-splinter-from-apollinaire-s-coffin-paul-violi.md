# Lines Written on a Splinter from Apollinaire's Coffin
## Paul Violi
Look at me now, I stand before you, a man
       whom life has made a gullible skeptic.
Life so obvious and strange,
            so full of marvels and dross
even in our sleep we create monuments
                even in our grave

What more can we ask
than to never know what to expect
        Each day has a different emissary
Yesterday she was sharp-eyed
    She was calm and free
so calm I could hear the vines grow
              and the mad fluttering
        of tiger-swallowtails
fill the pink-blossomed tree
              outside her window

The day before that
           she was an aloof odalisque
  from whose embrace I collapsed
trying to catch my breath
                                  alas
while she cracked her knuckles

Whenever I walk in the woods
                           I’m side tracked
One day by fauns
    simple    nearly imperceptible
          as they shift into light and shade,
the next by a cool steady breath
               that led me
   to what I thought was a small cave
        which I entered
                 and found an immense cavern
 that lengthwise
                               toe to fingertip
revealed the exact shape of a giant

There’s one for each of us
      to try and measure
                       an incalculable absence
formed by every marvelous thing
      we have seen or done
dripping down into earth
                     creating a mold
      we would normally attribute
to something more precise
      and instantaneous
                 gods’ weaponry
lightning or forgetfulness

But no, it’s ours
huge, anatomically detailed, empty,
            its every crease and line
illumined by nothing more than
            our grateful selves,
  its magnitude compressed
          into the cool narrow song
our flurried life
                 welcomes as inspiration

Though whistling a mere shadow tune
                                I emerged
         Height: 5'10"
         Weight: 172
         Shoe-size: 10 1/2
         Wingspan: 26', at least in the morning
           that time of blessed isolation
before we have to ask
      Where does it go,
                             whatever we know?
Where can we go
    when our wings weigh more
                                   than the rest of us?

Already weighed down with manual and atlas
      my bookshelf has begun to sag
into the perpetual smile of a dimwit
    I’ll prop it up
         with twelve oversized volumes
of The History of the Fierce
    I’ll stand and slowly spin
         in the center of great cities again
                folding and unfolding my map
        like a punctured accordion

   Vanity and sweet knowledge
We had to dig through ashes
                            with a lead shovel
to reach this silence
     Wave your burning flags O stars
My heart’s on my sleeve
                             my money on Science
I’ll agree to banishment
                to a remote isle
as long as I’m allowed to bring
the book of my choice:
                 the dictionary
       A shadow isle the clouds of my choice
             cast on the luxurious sea
What more can I ask?
     For a wilder lie to make
                  the truth more real
                                                  and a voice
that will carry it to you
over the cavernous sky: Altocumulus
                                                  Stratovarious
