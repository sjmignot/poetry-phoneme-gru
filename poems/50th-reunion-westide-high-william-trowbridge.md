# 50th Reunion: Westide High
## William Trowbridge
How did we get here so suddenly,
with our bags and baggage, looking
the worse for wear, the ones misfortune

hasn't wrung into anything-but-perfect
strangers? Old buddies, old loves,
old antagonists chat at the bar

in the Hilton lobby; white-haired, no-haired
dyed-haired, ringers for those oldsters
so irrelevant to proms and cruising,

to study halls and going steady—to life
as we knew it. The smithereens
of yesteryear, mostly orphans who’ve buried

Mom and Dad, we’re holding out
in a Guadalcanal of hazard and heart-soreness:
edema, angina, sarcoma, thrombosis.

Casualties mount, as do the MIAs.
Why aren't we vexed? Why aren't we
screaming? Never mind; we're here, upright,

and don't have time to skip the niceties,
which never seemed so nice,
or to sweat the threats, as the dead,

ever younger, smile toward the future
from our senior yearbook. It's too late
for a fallback plan. Tonight,

we'll savor the motel cuisine, pass
the Inglenook, and believe there's nothing
opulent as this departure.
