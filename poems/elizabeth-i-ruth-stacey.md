# Elizabeth I
## Ruth Stacey
Woman was made to serve and obey man,
Man must obey God. Wife: man can command.

A natural order, God's ordained plan;
A woman must bow down to her husband.

        _England needs an heir so I must marry
_
      But yet I prevaricate and tarry.

A Queen when she weds is suddenly less,
The elevated bridegroom now soars high.

The prize: Kingship and a Queen to undress,
To win this all men would flatter and lie.

        _Robert Dudley calls me and I long to go,
_
       For I am soft and made of melting snow.

Once wedded the Queen is precarious,
At the mercy and caprice of the King.

Childbirth deadly, bloody and dangerous,
The dire consequence of mortal loving.

        _A virgin Queen I am and will remain.
_
       No man commands: I rule, ever the same.
