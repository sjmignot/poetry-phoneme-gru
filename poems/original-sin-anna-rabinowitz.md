# Original Sin
## Anna Rabinowitz
Baby is unique
                               untainted, original

                                               We know she is special


Every baby is

She arrives without baggage to hamper

                her way through tunnels or time

but she demands attention

                              AND HOW

Baby
               means to survive

aims to be fed, changed, bathed

                                                           resorting to no
more than a cry
                                             a squirm


               I observe Baby
now that she

                               breathes on her own

I swear I’ll keep copious notes

  I’ll invite her for dinner or lunch
                                                               for a glug of
lukewarm milk

I vow to take good care          I WILL

Why, then, does she bathe in the sink


                No one, not a single one, close by to lift her out


Why, then, does she not grow

Neglected Baby                    _Pauvre Enfant_


I have asked Baby to forgive me


 _Baby, Baby stay          Baby, Baby stay_

Do not become a stab in my brain

                              a chronic ache
a shrouded shout
                              a question mark laid out

in the morgue

                              daily vivisection

vapor-spiral woe going mad
beyond control though the venue is small
                                 and it doesn’t matter where one sleeps


There is evil in the world

It awaits Baby

Sins                              even Sloth
                               fiesta through hills and vales

               each time she is born


Morals and meanings stumble

                             but Sins know how to tango and tap

They make nimble partners
                               on the ballroom floor

Like tigers

        they stalk their prey

                                                      Lead, follow, tight
embrace

Baby in a frame, a pose
                              in a box


Tricky moves
                              l
                              a
                              n
                              g
                              u
                              i
                              d               obambulations

                                               warm morning          sunny day

One, two, three, four         one, two, three, four

We touch, we part

                                        We yearn for tender mores


Baby beware
              Baby be quick

Jump for the sky

                 Match to your flame

Watch the flares fly

Baby, there’s scorch here
