# The President Flies Over
## Patricia Smith
Aloft between heaven and them,
 __
I babble the landscape—what staunch, vicious trees,
what cluttered roads, slow cars. This is my
 __
country as it was gifted me—victimless, vast.
The soundtrack buzzing the air around my ears
continually loops ditties of eagles and oil.
I can’t choose. Every moment I’m awake,
aroused instrumentals channel theme songs,
speaking
what I cannot.
 __
I don’t ever have to come down.
I can stay hooked to heaven,
dictating this blandness.
My flyboys memorize flip and soar.
They’ll never swoop real enough
to resurrect that other country,
 __
won’t ever get close enough to give name
to tonight’s dreams darkening the water.
 __
I understand that somewhere it has rained.
