# The Wedding Planners
## Gregory Pardlo
We need a preacher who’ll say _up in here_ instead of  _herein_.
Our vows should reference calla lilies and the snowy pistils they
jab ardently at our faces. Let’s place their linty, foul-mouthed kiss
at the center of satin table cloths white as bee boxes and
us buzzing like the ichthyic insects we’ll invent: “coddle-
fish” finning the air, murmuring for words beyond _civil_ and
 _ceremony_ , beyond moderation, all our senses under assault.
