# Las Aves Vacias
## Mark Waldron
All the new birds
are made of nothing.

They have nothing inside
(for anti-ballast)

and those insides
are surrounded

in an outside nothing
that has its own

flibberti hole.
The birds,

theyâ€™re nothinging
up there

in the nothing trees,
or on nothing roofs

under a nothing sky.
They fly of course,

but what is flying
if not nothing?
