# A Knock
## Debra Nystrom
Vinnie Two Crow from the trailer at the school crossroads
has walked up through the snow, bringing a loaf
of pumpkin bread. Takes her big boots off
and sits for coffee. _Clem’s always treated us good._
 _—You up here had too much trouble._ I open the bread,
and she asks about the quilt in my hoop. Stray
lightning quilt, charred toys quilt—I don’t need to say
that. _If you want,_ she says, _I brought some sage along. Good_
 _smoke might take away the bad, I told Clem out at the barn._
 _—If you got an old bowl or something to burn it in._
