# Anima Writes a Letter Home
## Nabina Das
Dear mother and father and old and young people of my home. Dear pets and
weeds and flowers and footfalls. I write to you in a script speckled with
time. I write to the language of a poet and many who chanted after her. I
quote those verses which are laments, songs, praises, and warnings. The
laments are about not being of your skin, your tongue, your high heaven. The
songs are about television screens, newsprint din, and the men with the
megaphone going around shutting people’s windows down. The praises are to
those that wear spotless clothes, hidden weapons, buck-skin shoes, and plastic
faces. The warnings are about daring to speak, daring to say I’m two languages
not one, I’m three faces not one, and I’m a quarter bile not full. Dear people
of my city, town, lane, and invisible spaces, tell me, how do I return to you?
It is the night of the patient moon. But the doorkeepers are asking for proof
that I lived here, the watchful voices are mocking my  wandering toes, and the
vigilantes are simply admiring their righteous claws.

I, Anima, stand bewildered in the midst of midnight’s jowl. What is it, why is
it that for many there’s no home? Although it is _chaand raat,_ the night of
the moon? And a child’s tearful whisper: Take me to Eid tomorrow, Ma, take me
to Eid. I, Anima, ask you to wait for me to find out the answer when I carry
the grasshopper home.
