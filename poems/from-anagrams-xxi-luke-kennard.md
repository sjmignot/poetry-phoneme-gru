One of Halberg’s more whimsical decisions: just when the action is coming to a
head, attempt to pull off
something formally innovative. “Underwritten? Lithe!” could have been a note
to his detractors in this
metaphorical on-screen corrections list. Each one of its 23 scenes was
followed by a “what really happened”
reveal, until the audience ran out even of false hope. “It was a bold
decision, and by bold I mean stupid,”
says Ingram. “I tried to reason with him: if you go to pull the rug out from
under somebody’s feet 23 times
they’re just go- and step off the he had that kind trick in mind
the table cloth cutlery, crockery, undisturbed. over and over until the very
smashes
hell.” The whole an unrealized them share a captors and
K, and Cain are together as the

no, we jump-cut to their separation and Father K weeps hoarsely as their hands
are tied behind their backs. After an inappropriate remark about Adah, Cain
kicks an AK-47 from the weaker-looking patrolman’s skinny arms and scatters
the rest in a hail of bullets. But no, we jump-cut to Cain being repeatedly
pistol- whipped by the same patrolman. It seems unnecessary to list the
others. This is now a world where honor is an anaesthetic and the saint is as
fictional as the elf. They beg for water. Cain takes a bullet to the knee.
