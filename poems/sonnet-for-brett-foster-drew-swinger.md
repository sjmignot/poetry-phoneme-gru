# Sonnet for Brett Foster
## Drew Swinger
I was reading Jeffrey Goldberg’s new piece
In _The Atlantic_  — it was the one about
President Obama’s decision not
To be persuaded by a commonplace
That our credibility hinges on the use
Of swift and massive lethal force despite
Pressure even from his own Cabinet
Appalled that Assad shelled Ghouta with sarin gas —
When I thought of your poem on the way
Of denial, “Via Negativa,” whose lines
Celebrated their (your rhyme) reticence.
Why am I even talking this way to you?
I watched you being buried, yet in the end
I wonder if I had ever been your friend.
