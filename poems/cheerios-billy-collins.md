# Cheerios
## Billy Collins
One bright morning in a restaurant in Chicago
as I waited for my eggs and toast,
I opened the _Tribune_ only to discover
that I was the same age as Cheerios.

Indeed, I was a few months older than Cheerios
for today, the newspaper announced,
was the seventieth birthday of Cheerios
whereas mine had occurred earlier in the year.

Already I could hear them whispering
behind my stooped and threadbare back,
 _Why that dude’s older than Cheerios
_
the way they used to say

 _Why that’s as old as the hills_ ,
only the hills are much older than Cheerios
or any American breakfast cereal,
and more noble and enduring are the hills,

I surmised as a bar of sunlight illuminated my orange juice.
