# Honorary Jew
## John Repp
The first year, I grated potatoes, chopped onions
_&_ watched. The second year, I fed all but the eggs

into the machine _&_ said _I'll do the latkes &_ did,
my pile of crisp delights borne to the feast by the wife

who baffled me, our books closed, banter hushed,
money useless in the apartment— _house_ , my in-laws called it,

new-wave thump at one end, ganja reek at the other—
in which she'd knelt to tell the no one who listened

_no more no      no more no_ a three-year-old mouthing
the essential prayer. The uncle made rich by a song

stacked three _&_ dug in, talking critics _&_ Koch—
everyone crunching now, slathering applesauce, slurping tea—

talking Rabin _&_ Mehitabel, radio _&_ Durrell,
how a song is a poem or it isn't a song

_&_ vice-versa. Done, he pointed a greasy finger
at me, said _You can't be a goy. You—I say it_

_for all to hear—are an honorary Jew!_
which, impossible dream, my latkes lived up to

for five more years. Then the wailing.
Then the dust.
