# Looking at Maps

If they'd had writing in time, Cuba could have been Crete,
watery source of the Minoans and thus the Greeks.

What's lost? A possible us
growing like new foliage out of stony ground, emerging?

Last voice, first, a whole world calling—
awful, inaudible—into the unstoppable loud (roaring!)

hurricane-force sea wind.
