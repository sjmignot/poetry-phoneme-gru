# The Gentle Art of Shabby Dressing
## Spencer Short
There’s nothing dandier than threadbare threads
worn by a discerning shabby dresser.
A collar’s fret or subtle fray is not _lesser_
because it’s worn away but models instead

the bespoke tailoring of time itself.
Done poorly—the gentleman farmer’s
piecemeal pastoral, that NoHo charmer’s
duct-taped boots—it’s like an unread bookshelf

of secondhand prose: a too-studied pose.
Done well, it draws you in to draw you near,
reveals the intricate pattern in the years’
inexorable ravel. Between _decompose_

and _deconstruct_ , what seemed a foppish quirk
grows wise. Design undone. We wear time’s work.
