# In Syrup
## Naomi Replansky
In syrup, in syrup,
In syrup we drown,

Who sell ourselves
With a sparkling smile.

Padded with pathos
Our winding sheet.

The bomb bounded
By buxom beauties.

Horror gelded
By the happy ending.

How can we swim
Who hold to our haloes?

Down we go, down
In syrup, in syrup.
