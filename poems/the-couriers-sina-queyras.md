# The Couriers
## Sina Queyras
Words from a leaf on the shell of a snail?
 _Tendency as reciprocity etched in shale._

Cider vinegar wrapped in sealskin?
 _Accept it, so little is genuine._

A box on a meteor compelled by earth?
 _Lies, emptiness, grief: it’s not a first._

Frost on the dock at Penetanguishene?
 _Tears from Lake Huron, Erie, and Michigan._

Not a moment to yourself?
_Don’t let love put you on a shelf._

A preponderance of errors?
_The soft one sucks her rivers._

Love, love, needs no reason.
 _Yes, yes, yes, is my season._
