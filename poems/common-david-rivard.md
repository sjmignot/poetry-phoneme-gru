# Common
## David Rivard
The American common is no collective or princedom
but privacies of need & pleasure as they intersect
in public spaces, tho the insufferable powers that be
breed their plots behind our backs, thinking us
witless, seemingly blind to their afflicted intentions,
just a bunch of demographic motormouths & screw-ups
to be targeted by commodities traders & search engines—
a marketing niche for every need, stereotypes
tagged by algorithms— _here_ is a typical team
of baton twirlers in an airport bar, each of them clad
in foxy red track suits & tuned-in to the dollhouse
stimulations of pigeon-talking sales reps; _there_
is a previously undetected aggregation of retirees,
evangelical camp kids, kickass bowlers,
and mothy nuns in starched wimples, for whom
the news of the day means the aging boy-man
Hugh Grant's fear of double chins—neither of
these or any other data dump entirely false,
but so narrow-minded sometimes as to lose sight
of us entirely: the midtown lady in Capris,
a four-square surgeon off-duty  & headed out
to play poker, the plumber fly-fishing by the river—
a sky of twilight slate now—not a word written on it.
