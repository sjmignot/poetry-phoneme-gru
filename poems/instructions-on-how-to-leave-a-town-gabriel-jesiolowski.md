# Instructions on How to Leave a Town

                                                                         ^

now you have to go back through Ohio just to manage a few sweaters because
it’s getting cold out there



                              pack two grey-green duffels / most of your
clothes are torn
                              what else                    do you have to show
for yourself
                    stay in motels     drink bourbon & cut your fingertips on
                                        the zippers of your jeans / throw the
oranges at the hero
ships on the walls                     forget her


                                                                         ^

          her touch—nearly seven hundred days away / the desk littered with
candles &
                              letters / last night folk music & a light bulb
swinging     humming


          sink backed up & the water flooded the dirty blue tiles—you just

                    between two bodies          smokestacks line the sky


                                                                         ^

troubled by your body, you’re trembling at the gas station

                                                  stay in a poorly insulated
farmhouse north of the city
                                                    wake to a lack of rain, an
unbroken sky


                                                   remember the moon from last
night
                                                   that seemed to drift


                                                   if god were uneasy
                                                   you would not know
