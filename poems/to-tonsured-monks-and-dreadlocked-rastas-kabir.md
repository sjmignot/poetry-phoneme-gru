# To tonsured monks and dreadlocked Rastas
## Kabir
Translated from the Hindi by Arvind Krishna Mehrotra
To tonsured monks and dreadlocked Rastas,
To idol worshippers and idol smashers,
To fasting Jains and feasting Shaivites,
To Vedic pundits and Faber poets,
The weaver Kabir sends one message:
The noose of death hangs over all.
Only Rama’s name can save you.
Say it now.
