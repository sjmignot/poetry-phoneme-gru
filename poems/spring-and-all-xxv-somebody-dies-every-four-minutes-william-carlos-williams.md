# Spring and All: XXV [Somebody dies every four minutes]
## William Carlos Williams
Somebody dies every four minutes
in New York State —

To hell with you and your poetry —
You will rot and be blown
through the next solar system
with the rest of the gases —

What the hell do you know about it ?

AXIOMS

Do not get killed

Careful Crossing Campaign
Cross Crossings Cautiously

THE HORSES      black
                                 &
PRANCED             white

What’s the use of sweating over
this sort of thing, Carl ; here
it is all set up —

Outings in New York City

Ho for the open country

Dont’t stay shut up in hot rooms
Go to one of the Great Parks
Pelham Bay for example

It’s on Long Island sound
with bathing, boating
tennis, baseball, golf, etc.

Acres and acres of green grass
wonderful shade trees, rippling brooks

               Take the Pelham Bay Park Branch
               of the Lexington Ave. (East Side)
               Line and you are there in a few
               minutes
