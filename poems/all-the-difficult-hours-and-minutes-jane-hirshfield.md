# All the Difficult Hours and Minutes
## Jane Hirshfield
All the difficult hours and minutes
are like salted plums in a jar.
Wrinkled, turn steeply into themselves,
they mutter something the color ofâ€Š sharkfins to the glass.
Just so, calamity turns toward calmness.
First the jar holds the _umeboshi_ , then the rice does.
