# Curvilinear
## Biswamit Dwibedy
As a rule, we are only because
men have looked down upon
us with such kindness
straight into our eyes.
Warriors stare each other down.

Reach its climax at the _Shikhara,_ or the Vortex
is the subject of the verse. Has been, since way before
Pound’s age, peaks like the city all over a pleasure
we are not given credit for. Like how to make time
move by not moving. How to make a new time
in the palm of your hand, a son made of dirt
is our most popular deity, with an elephant’s
borrowed tusk and a half
the trunk, which leads to good luck
depending on what side it points to
sitting idle an idol at your desk.
