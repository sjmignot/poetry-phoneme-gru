# A Cigarette
## Ilya Kaminsky
Watch —
Vasenka citizens do not know they are evidence of happiness

in a time of war,
each is a ripped-out document of laughter.

God,
deaf  have something to tell
that not even they can hear —

you will find me, God,
like a dumb pigeon’s beak I am
pecking
every way at astonishment.

If you
climb a roof in the Central Square of a bombarded city, you will see my people
and me —
one neighbor thieves a cigarette
another gives a dog
a pint of sunlit beer.
