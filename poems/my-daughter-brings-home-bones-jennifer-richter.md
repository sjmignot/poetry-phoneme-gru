flat teeth attached, dozens of thin arced parts. This one for me—40

makes an arrow; sun lights them like a sign. She'll go: undeniable

legs; the bones in line make a spine. My height. On the driveway
lies my body—when it held her—inside out. The way she came:
like bones. Gleaming, after living in my dark. Gleaming. So I can
always find her.
