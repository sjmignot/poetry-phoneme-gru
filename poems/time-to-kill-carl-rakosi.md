# Time to Kill
## Carl Rakosi
a man and his dog

what fun
chasing twigs
into the water!

young girls bicycle by
in pairs and plaid shorts

a wind so soft
one’s whole
back tingles
with cilia

a gentle lake

the sun boils
at the center,
radiates the zone
for man
            and lays
a healing pad
across his nape

an airplane small and flat
as a paper model
roars behind
the Virgilian scene

an old man
tips his straw hat
down to shade
                     his eyes,
pulls up his fishline
and moves on
to a new spot

the poor small
wood louse
crawls along
the bark ridge
for his life
