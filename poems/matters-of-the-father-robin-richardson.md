# Matters of the Father
## Robin Richardson
She could live on chips on paint chips potato chips the poker chips he stacked
in towers on the nightstand she could live in glass or underground or in his
Cadillac she lived inside his head his cowboy boots she found a scorpion in
once stabbed him in the shoulder by mistake he called her lucky charm called
her witch made her practice in a walk-in closet how to cast a spell draw
fortune how to make herself more pretty she dreamed she buried the brother she
didnâ€™t have dreamed her brother was dwarfed he died when her father called her
pet he died when her father left she learned to live in the parking lot alone
outside the casino learned to live at the bar by the pool tables theatres
where men shot men raped women shot women shot themselves skinned animals ran
one another over and over she learned to live in his smoke his vodka his idea
of perfection the perfect girl the perfect evening unencumbered by her needs
she dreamed of being buried on her knees her knees are plum so cute and sore
so sturdy the father is dying now the girl is grown she dances with knives in
her panties the men love her knives she loves the mistakes she makes the
knives are her father the men are her father the panties are wool are sheep
she dances in sheep with knives she strips off the sheep and for a moment
feels her flesh at peace with her flesh she almost puts away the knives almost
lets the men lose interest there is still so much work to do
