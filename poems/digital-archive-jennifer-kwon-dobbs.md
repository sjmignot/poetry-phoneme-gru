How should I index myself so that you can retrieve & cut me
               from the 1970 catalogs

of infant headshots & paste me beside you?
               This I wanted to know

while the grandfather held up his 1940 photo
               of three men laughing beside a new Buick. He said,

"If you could identify them, then my life would be changed forever."
               If anyone knows the names

for paper as vulnerable as skin, then please tell me
               if I find my birth documents

burned, ripped, or yellowed with information missing,
               or if I don't find them at all? I listened

as the panelists advised the grandfather to search the database,
               my body like too much information

unsorted: all errors, useless without a way to see it
               linked to get somewhere. My arms disappearing

while the grandfather passed his laminated photo around the room.
