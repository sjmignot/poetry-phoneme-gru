# Perihan
## Sara Deniz Akant
it doesn’t matter when I cross.
two seconds and they’re gone.
the ferry facing Ulus. the trees
that spanked of green. the narrow
bags of temples. beyond that –
just – these Peri scenes

            _when the human body sweats_
 _the skin produce an oil_

            _when Peri bodies sweat_
 _it does not produce the oil_

the ropes fall to the pavement
their waters slap me still
their green glow sweats
into the pavement waters
slap me still –

            _I could curl among the roses_

 _I would make an aqualung_

we will reach the edge of this walk soon.
all lights torn out for fuel.

            _move my fingers in the dark_

awoke without a start.
Peri here – my name is Peri –

my name is _Perihan_
