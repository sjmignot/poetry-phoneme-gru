# Want Song
## Lance Larsen
Two musics washing over me, and morning asks,
 _which loneliness comes closest to the inky
_
chromatics inside you? How can I answer?
The cricket in the tarantula’s cage
chirrs the next world.
Meanwhile, scraps of Chopin float
up the stairs on my wife’s trilling fingers
which played me whole
worlds ago, last night, when _I_ was buried in _we._
