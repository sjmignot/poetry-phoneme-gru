# Poem Which Talks Back to Itself
## Sharon Olds
For Etan Patz
The parents whose boy went off to school
that morning — the police may have found someone
who saw their son, alive, after
they saw him for the last time. _Step away!_
Someone who saw that elfin face
change, at the word “soda.” _Step back!_
And change again, and change. And down
the basement steps, down into the earth,
the stairs down into the underworld.
 _Don’t go there. Close your eyes._ Someone
may know the unbearable — someone
in custody. O, “custody.”
A wall of dirt, a wall of stone,
a bare bulb, like the uterus upside
down. No Kaddish, no washing of the dead,
no linen shroud, no company
through the long night.
Whatever honor can be kept for him —
his pure and whole honor is kept
by his parents, for the rest of the hard
labor of their lives. All this time,
they could not die, so they’d be here, in case
he came back. _Unspeakable_. And now,
the one taken in for questioning cries out,
“I don’t know why, I don’t know why.”
He will not tell. Is he holding that hour
to himself. Did he hold that child in his hands,
39 years ago.
Vanished. The spirit mattered away.
And the dear matter —  _don’t_. The bag,
the truck. The landfill or the barge, the burial
at sea — the dispersal, the containment within
the bounds of the oceans, crested on top and
cragged at the floor where the innards of the planet pour
up, molten, through fissures — contained
in the air bound by the atmosphere, the
clouds of mourning pressing against
the inner surface of the casing. _Shut
_
your mouth. Put down your pen. Drop
your weapon! Stop! In the name of the law
and the prophets. At his birth, the history of the earth began.
