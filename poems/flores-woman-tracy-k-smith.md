# Flores Woman
## Tracy K. Smith
A species of tiny human has been discovered, which lived on the remote
Indonesian island of Flores just 18,000 years ago. . . . Researchers have so
far unearthed remains from eight individuals who were just one metre tall,
with grapefruit-sized skulls. These astonishing little people . . . made
tools, hunted tiny elephants and lived at the same time as modern humans who
were colonizing the area.
--Nature, October 2004
Light: lifted, I stretch my brief body.
Color: blaze of day behind blank eyes.

Sound: birds stab greedy beaks
Into trunk and seed, spill husk

Onto the heap where my dreaming
And my loving live.

Every day I wake to this.

Tracks follow the heavy beasts
Back to where they huddle, herd.

Hunt: a dance against hunger.
Music: feast and fear.

This island becomes us.

Trees cap our sky. It rustles with delight
In a voice green as lust. Reptiles

Drag night from their tails,
Live by the dark. A rage of waves

Protects the horizon, which we would devour.
One day I want to dive in and drift,

Legs and arms wracked with danger.
Like a dark star. I want to last.
