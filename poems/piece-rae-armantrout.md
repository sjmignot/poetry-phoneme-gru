What is a brand?
The hopeful tag

on the tan underpants
that reads “Metaphor”

leaves everything
to the imagination

which by now
is plainly exhausted.

I could describe these tags
as so many

flapping tongues,
dropping hints

about a foreign designer,
himself largely a cover story.

Someone somewhere must sew a shirt
made entirely of red flags.

Untiring, music
rises
then falls through
its imagined past.
