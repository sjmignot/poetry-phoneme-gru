The camera is having trouble
focusing. A blurry spot
where the universe is.
Outside, a storm is brewing,
trashcans into windshields.
Outside agitators, a nebula
of thick dust. The images
are black and white but you can imagine
the green of this star's birth
as its extra spirals out.
This spring a cosmic mirage
where you could watch, on every television,
the death of a star in a supernova explosion
nine billion years ago across the cosmos.
Here in Sandtown, six men
have broken the spine of another.
It was a mistake
to send the camera out so quickly.
Easy to fix the lens
but nearly impossible to reach it,
as far out from us as it has drifted already.
