Big smelly bowel movements this blue January morning.

From the living room TV, a commercial from our TV company: _We’re the fastest,
the only —_

Meaning, _Love us above all others._

What makes poop more pungent on certain days?

A question for science.

From the living room TV: the powerful cite _Law_ , bark _Order_  —

Meaning, _Love us or else._

Years ago, a teacher said never to use the word “poop” in a poem.

Today, the icy kiss of the toilet seat wakes me up.

Today, I poop while my boyfriend shouts from the living room,   _Did you hear
that_ , meaning the atomic scientists who say we are now two & a half minutes
to midnight.

But still I marvel whenever poop comes out as one true Platonic tube.

I am trying to be marvelous.

& to make my enemies throw up.

I mean, if you shower with soap & eat well, maintaining consistent
gastrointestinal health, you should be ready for a rimjob or other forms of
anal play.

My boyfriend & I are not platonic.

From the TV: a white supremacist cites _Science_ , barks _Two sides to every
—_

I mean, up the throat, out the mouth: the fastest, the only way the powerful
will let go of their shit.

I mean, my boyfriend  & I are not into scat but if you are I hope your beloved
produces the most fragrant, citrusy shit.

I mean, is “shit” more or less literary than “poop”?

I mean, one winter night I got sick & pooped the bed.

& he just got up with me.

Helped strip the sheets, carry it all to the washer.

I kept saying, _I’m so sorry_ , shivering, _I’m so, I’m sorry_. But he said,
_What? Hey. I love you._
