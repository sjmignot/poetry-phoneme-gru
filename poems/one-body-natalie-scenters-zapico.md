# One Body

Two ids walk into one body & fight over whether to break melon on the kitchen
counter & eat it by the fistful or to throw the melon out a shut window &
watch it break on the pavement, stabbed by shards of glass.



ego

Sorry, for yelling through the speaker at the McDonald’s drive thru. Sorry,
for not letting you through the door first. Sorry, I ate the dozen donuts in
fifteen minutes over the sink. Sorry, I sound shrill, sound dumb, sound ditzy,
sound spacey. Sorry, mom. I mean, mamá.  I mean, miss. I mean, nevermind.



superego

Dear body: Cut the melon into slices with the sharpest knife you can find &
enjoy the pain you are causing this melon. Stop saying you’re sorry, instead
feel guilty for being shrill, being dumb, being ditzy,  being spacey. Feel
guilty because your mom is your mamá is your miss is the one who is guilty for
giving you this body with two ids,  & one ego, & one superego who hush-hushes
you whole.
