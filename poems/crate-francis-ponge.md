# Crate
## Francis Ponge
Halfway between _crib_ and _cage_ the French language puts _crate_ , a simple
slatted box for transporting those fruits that fall ill at the least lack of
air.

Built in such a way that it can be broken down effortlessly after use, it is
never used twice. It is really more perishable than the deliquescing
foodstuffs that it carries.

On the corners of streets that lead to the markets, it gleams like white wood
without woodâ€™s vanity. Still very new, and slightly surprised to find itself
in this awkward position, having been thrown into the gutter without hope of
retrieval, it remains a most likable object on whose fate we will not dwell
for long.
