# Creek
## Mark Levine
I suppose I shan’t go fishing
Pa, for fear of finding
We’re no fishers,
Our folk, for all our bent
For fish scraps and our
Tolerance for muck dwellers and the like.

This creek is like no other, Pa,
Inky cold and familiar,
Don’t drink from it, it
Commands, don’t kneel, don’t stare down

Or wash in it, don't pry your shoes from off
Your battered stubs, not yet, no jay
Flashes past and asks how you mean
To ask a shit creek to provide.

You exist. It would, too. It falls through
These viney half-corrupted patches of nettled hickory and oak
Into a muddy slough
Into a culvert, splitting

Around the treatment plant
Then joining itself back in a ramrod concrete
Channel beneath pavement;
Then into the lake, sludge, great
Lake.

Do you follow? It’s taking you somewhere, it matters
Not where, Pa, it’s a trip
At your command, inaudible.

It’s the postponed one
We would have scheduled in these winding down days
Together had we not been
What we made of us.
In the stagnant north woods.
In the pale thick end-of-knowing daylight.
