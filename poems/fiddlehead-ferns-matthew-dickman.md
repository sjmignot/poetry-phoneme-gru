# Fiddlehead Ferns
## Matthew Dickman
Olive seashells
in the air

you can eat.
The very inner of the inner ear

in the breeze.
Last night my son dreamt

about falling
out of trees.

I had almost forgotten
that we were

simians.

The fiddlehead turns
on itself but only ever in love.

Green cinnamon roll,
a snake too small to hunt

anyone.
Curled in like my son’s
fingers, his fists.

More beautiful than
a spider fern,

spun-in island,
moldy tongue of a hippopotamus,

the eye of the forest.

When my son wakes up
screaming

I don’t pick him up
right away.

I tell him where he is and who
I am.

At night all the fiddlehead
wants to do is sleep.

When I sleep
I dream about death adders curling

around his soft
body,

all of us making the same kinds of sounds.
