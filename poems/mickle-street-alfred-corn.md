# Mickle Street
## Alfred Corn
I’m queer for nouns or verbs that end in - _ickle_ ,
For bouncy trampolines, for trust and bluff.
We’re told by those downtown that La Morbid’s dull
Renouncing didn’t rustle up enough
Bling to dazzle more than a few of them.
Turn on a dime, a channel. Those we flip
Ring truer than the frilly stratagem
Fern bars used to unfurl, and we know zip
About karate or brass knucks. To battle
The meltdown blues, lay out your Cups and Swords.
Don’t doubt the Duke will hop down from the saddle,
His belt slung low. Check out the storyboards:
Next year he trades his roan for a motorcycle.
