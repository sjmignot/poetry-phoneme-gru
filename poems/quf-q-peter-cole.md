## Peter Cole
Fucked art thou, with luck, o reader within the palace within the palette
within the impatience within, who tilts his letters into the light of the
mind’s muttering unto itself, releasing their sounds to the _whirlpool fierce_
of an ear _to draw creations in_ —
Who brings forth a kiss of circumference, the glyphs hooked and loosened and
linking, as though they were dancing through moths of minutes and months like
wind—out of a god whose name is Gone ...
Fukkit and lukky art thou in the wind moving marjoram into the mint, the fuzz
and down of the former grazing the raised ribs of the other, the essences
borne—
Pheromones suddenly wafting, your eye catching the gradient greens and vein-
like patterns, the gray stubble of sage’s tongue, thick oregano’s glister and
whorl, stalks of thyme spiking the air on a kitchen porch or Sikinos slope
with its lavender flower, lit up, still, in June;
The blue film of night’s end rolling into white near dawn, the light by which
you know a friend, the ancients explain, from six feet off—or, a wolf from a
dog;
The glow of morning bougainvillea, its papery bracts in a breeze like prayer,
its bezeled ruby beginnings morphing into pinks- and magentas-to-come, cream-
tipped corollas on perfect display, style and stigma sheathing the anther;
Then creeping Christians’ dusky luster, in the shade at noon;
Almonds swelling jade drupes into the sinking summer, encoding spring’s
initial explosion;
Pomegranate’s garnet, pendant, containing—against the green of its arch and
stretch—six hundred seeds dark with light, glinting in its skin;
Fucked, art thou, and lucky, who translates it into the day as blessed—
So blessèd as in blasted art thou, in a way, in whom this knowing is
strengthened in bringing you down to the cords of arthritic knees,  wrestling
the gust of a given moment’s giving—like vapor—and  strangely grateful;
Blessèd art thou whose petitions are curses, whose fuck touches the  innermost
chamber, waking the king and queen in their slumber;
Blessèd the consonants funneling vowels,
In Scripture’s offering—a dove’s neck wrung, cakes unleavened and  mingled
with oil;
Blessèd the spirit’s meniscus within a letter typed or scrawled, as  not-
quite-deciphered codes of soul—
A pupil’s reaching through a sentence, slipping and reaching again, and again,
a teacher tracing the shape of her thinking;
Blessèd even the stink and politic rot of the day’s pronouncements on high,
_Liver of the blaspheming Jew, gall of goat, and slips of yew_ —
in action as Evil: the concrete Lego-like bunker and tower, bunker and tower,
barbwired cabbage and vines, shadows gliding as crows fly across the road to
the holy of hills and prefab huts, from which goat-like thugs emerge, watching
and then descending through a glowering slope- stepping prance, tribal fringes
trailing—their dance sick with a stiffened faith, wicking and blotching their
map of state, like a cancered scan,  eating away at its language and letters,
as _Gone_ yields _goon_ , or _gun_ , or _bone_ , where lips meet and part in
the “b” of all that’s brutal and also insidious, pointed to and taken on, in
the maybe pointless battle—
Evoking the hundred blessings the rabbis say need to be uttered daily, reading
the number— _me’ah_ (hundred)—into the word for _what_ , or _mah_ : “ _What_
does Becoming your God ask of you?” (Deuteronomy, 10:12);
And blessèd is never quite knowing, exactly, what those blessings should be.
