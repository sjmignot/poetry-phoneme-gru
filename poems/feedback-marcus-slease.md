I like that antique tea wagon and small television. I like the computer built
by your brother. I like the man in the yellow jacket as the guide. I like free
will and predestination and fate. I like how the mind reaches out to touch,
literally, the light of the stars. I like how the reader is possessed. I like
illusions of self that each new self is born into. I like if you love someone
set them on ﬁre. I like how the older lady steals the parking space. I like
the sickness of soul. I like how the reader is also being watched by the
narrator. The kangaroo leather documentary in the pub really pulled me in. The
many levels of watching really pulled me in. I like how the narrator ﬂickers
in and out. The last chapter is sharp and honest. The last chapter has many
serpents eating their tails. This builds habits of nature. This builds
emotional connection. This embodies the novel.
