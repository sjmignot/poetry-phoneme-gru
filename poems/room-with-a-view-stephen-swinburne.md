# Room with a View
## Stephen Swinburne
I live in a room by the sea,
where the view is great and the food is free.
Some of the tenants come and go.
Some I eat, if they're too slow.
One end of me is firmly locked.
The other end just gently rocks.
I live in a room by the sea.
It's perfect for an anemone.
