# Passage
## Ranjit Hoskote
Ask him at four
the con man with the fancy herb
whether the shirt will still fit
the grain still stream millward
the girl still hold her balance
on the fraying rope

How to hold and frame
no, see see see
as if for the first time
the raw unpolished yellow skin
of the door the warm brick skin
of the terrace the downy cream floor

You must be alert
to coffee stain and mosquito bite
red cloud of panic on the inner arm
the river’s pulse beating in the brain
its gilded fish bursting the weir of sleep
source forgotten mouth unknown

upstream and downstream braided
one current from which the wounded dolphin leaps
slipping from this skin of water to the next
finding balance on a wave
it’s you and me both
asking who’s really native in passage
