# The Salt Stronger
## Fred Marchant
I have seen the legislators
on their way,
the jacketless men
in mid-winter who will cast
their votes like stones for this war.

Men who have to cross the street
through slush
and over gutter, their cuffs
now vaguely blued with a salt
that dries in dots where it splashes,

and mingles with the finely
woven cloth
of the chalk-stripe suits,
the _soi-disant_ practical men,
you can see them now tiptoeing,

now leaping, balletic, windsor-knotted,
fragrant
and shaved,
they pass, they pass
the window of the Capitol Deli

wherein I am writing to my friend
in Baghdad,
he a “witness for peace,”
a poet who for years has wondered
what good poetry is or has been or does.

I compose today’s answer from here,
saying,
 _I think of poetry
_
as a salt dug from a foreign mine
 _that arrives like a miracle in Boston_
 __
_as pellets to break underfoot_
 _and melt_
 _the dangerous plated ice_
 _and cling to the acknowledged lawmakers,_
 _to stay with them in their dreams,_
 __
_to eat at the cloth and reach down_
 _to the skin_
 _and beyond the calf_
 _into the shin. I think the soul_
 _is equivalent to bone, and that conscience_
 __
_must hide in the marrow,_
 _float in the rich fluids_
 _and wander the honeycomb at the center._
 _There, and not in the brain,_
 _or even the heart is where_
 __
_the words attach, where they land_
 _and settle,_
 _take root after the long_
 _passage through the body’s by-ways._
 _Just think,_ I write, _of how some poetry rolls_

 _off the tongue, then try to see the tongue_
 _in the case_
 _that faces me, a curious,_
 _thick extension of cow-flesh_
 _fresh from a butcher’s block, grainy and flush._
 __
_I think that if my tongue alone could talk_
 _it would swear_
 _in any court that poetry_
 _tastes like the iodine in blood,_
 _or the  copper in spit, and makes a salt stronger than tears._
