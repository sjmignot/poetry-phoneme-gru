# Saltine
## Michael McFee
How well its square
fit my palm, my mouth,
a toasty wafer slipped
onto the sick tongue
or into chicken soup,

each crisp saltine a tile
pierced with 13 holes
in rows of 3 and 2,
its edges perforated
like a postage stamp,

one of a shifting stack
sealed in wax paper
whose noisy opening
always signaled _snack,_
peanut butter or cheese

thick inside Premiums,
the closest we ever got
to serving _hors d’oeuvres:_
the redneck’s hardtack,
the cracker’s cracker.
