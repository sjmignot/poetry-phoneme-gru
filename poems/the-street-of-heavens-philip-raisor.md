# The Street of Heavens

_           Tell me how you die and I will tell you
           who you are._
                                       Octavio Paz
I stand in line. The woman ahead of me,
blowzy-haired and angry, is told that grace
is the act of restraint and road-kill is not a sport.
She can choose to wait or test the judgment
at another entrance. I know that morality,
penance, a kind heart don't matter, nor the faith
I embraced or didn't, the people I saved. I know
the key is where I land on the scale of commitment.

Earnhardt, Sr., died for the game, and got in.
Many ancient Egyptians buried juggling balls
with them, as though endless practice and craft
were their gifts to the next world. They entered.
I ask if I can peek in, maybe stand on the edge
and look into the vast canyon of pits, arenas,
fields, fairways, pools, rings, tables, tracks,
courts, beaches, forests, mountains

where war is forbidden. Here is what I bring
for review: a nasty fastball, a runner-up ring,
individual initiative, a contrary attitude, the heart
of a poet. I bring a willingness to run like an outlaw,
honor the Greeks and Makahiki, invent new games,
practice past dusk, play on the second squad,
and keep score until I can get in the game
with eternity left on the clock. I hope it is enough.
