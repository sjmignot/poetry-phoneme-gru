# To Make Color
## Ryler Dustin
Every morning, my grandmother cleaned the Fischer stove
in the back of the trailer, lifted ash in a shovel, careful

not to spill the white-gray dust. _Precious_ , she said, her breath
smoking in the cold. _Precious_ in winter's first lavender

not-quite-lightâ€”and you could smell it, the faintest acrid hint
of ash, a crispness calling you from bed. You could watch her

cap it in a chicory coffee can to stack among others, back bent
from a long-gone fever. _For the garden in spring_ , she said.
