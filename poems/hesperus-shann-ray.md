# Hesperus
## Shann Ray
My four-year-old daughter handed me a card.
_To Daddy_ written on the front
and inside a rough field
of  five-pointed lights, and the words
 _You’re my favorite Daddy in the stars_.

In this western night we all light the sky
like Vega, Deneb, Altair, Albireo,
the Summer Triangle,
Cygnus the Swan, our hair
tangled with wood and gravel,
our eyes like vacant docks
that beckon every boat.

Tell me about the word
stars, I said.

Oh, she said. Sorry.
I didn’t know
how to spell world.
