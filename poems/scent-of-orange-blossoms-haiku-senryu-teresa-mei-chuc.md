# scent of orange blossoms: haiku/senryu
## Teresa Mei Chuc
this morning
weaving Chi in the garden
invisible ball in my hand


*


Halong Bay
battle distant memory
smoke from Gulf of Tonkin


*


did the atom
ever know its destiny
how our hands create?










A student asked me,
“Why do your people
believe in dragons?”


*


river birch –
undressing
in the wind


*


the solid bones of elk antlers
or branches of a limber pine –
memory










bobcat with mange
unwatered plants
also dying


*


mountain lion
her land, before ours
invasive plants


*


scent of orange blossoms –
memories of my late grandma
who planted this tree









yarrow seedlings
pop up a week later –
each moment a small beginning


*


stopped in my tracks
by a primrose blooming –
I, too, will overcome this


*


dinner
a bowl of rice and soy sauce
food to survive on


*


my heart
the Santa Ana winds today
branches fall to the ground
