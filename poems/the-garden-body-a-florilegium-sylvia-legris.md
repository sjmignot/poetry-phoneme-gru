# The Garden Body: A Florilegium
## Sylvia Legris
1



A pepper of  bees opens the pupils.
_An ensemble of aromatics_
Chorus aphrodisia, mariner’s root,
bright sky and night star, heavenly
rainbow. Amethyst, azure, blue
flower-de-luce. Flowering ring.

•

White archangelic the bee nettle,
the dead nettle. A hide of nettle cloth,
of finely-nerved sedge. Take heed
the edges, the pipes, the passages,
the petal corridor, the corolla tube.

•

A blossom is a throat. Rose oil and hip.
A ripped rose is a voice organ, time-cut
and curt. Royally red and confidence-
keeping, redder than Mars, redder than
hot days and parched, Venus on the lips.



2



Muscle rose. Flesh rose.
_A verge toward red_
Then rustling redshank rose.
Vines ascend the arch of aorta.
Mercurial, the climbing nightshade,
the bundle-branched bittersweet.


•

White-spotted hellebore under Jupiter
and wind. Oak lungs, jovial lungs.
Sea rush blows the lungs with sweet rose,
carmine and sanguine, flaming red.
Candleberry fires the blood.

•

Red is antispasmodic, cardiovascular.
Great garden patience of Mars.
May-blossom, hawthorn. Spring
gushes red-veined with sorrel, bloodwort
below Jupiter, red dock for longevity.



3



Venus stokes the throatwort.
_Ringing with wasps_
The good leaf. The rose noble.
_L’herbe du siège_ slackens
the isthmus of the fauces.
Gash-red and choking rose.


•

Double tongue. Bay laurel.
Daphne of the sun.
Yarrow charms wasps,
snuffs the inveterate headache.
Daphne sings the bees from the ears.

•

The voice reeds are a Queen Anne’s lace
of wasps. Mercury abounds with buzz
and wild carrot, jump-starts speech
with hoar-strange words, a gargle
of hog’s fennel and brimstone wort.



4



Under Leo, composure.
_Touchwood and rue_
Herb of grace. Anti-magical.
Vinegar of the four thieves.
Poison against poison. Rue before regret.
Touch wood Ruta sets the garden free.


•

Lightning sulfur the garden prone
to primrose and paroxysm. Pellitory-
of-the-wall quells old hacking. An old cough.
A new moon courtesy of wild clary.
Eyebright. Clear eye ( _en toute bonne foi_ ).

•

Sweep away the broom, the burdock,
the beastly antipathy between ash tree
and adder. Snakeweed. Dragon’s blood.
Devil’s bit. Serpent’s tongue. Wickedness
(a weak moon) licked & licked & licked.



5



What a commotion! Wild rocket, a racket
_Flesh and blood_
of wake robin, cuckoo point, the clear
caroling rise & fall. Volatile dog’s mercury.
Dog’s-grass. Dog rose. Hot fits and cold
metallic blue. The indecisive indigo.


•

So the garden bellyaches. So what
the gripes? Rows rife with tormentil,
gallant herb of the sun. Five fingers,
flesh and blood. Stamina, life’s long
thread, root-red, the unhindered heart.

•

Leaves respire and rain returns blood-veined
and blood dock, blood-colored juices. Red poppy
a headache. Heartichoke the downhearted.
Loosestrife calms the fugitive scarlet.
Sweet slumber. The fleshy rootstock.



6



Enlist imagination under the banner of science.
_Erasmus Darwin,_
Flora attired by the elements.
_his Botanic Muse_
Sea lavender, sea holly, sundrops.
Jacob’s ladder reaching ether.
Wind rose. Sun rose. Water grass.


•

The loves of the plants. (The economy of vegetation.)
 _Root, pith, lobes, plume, calyx, coral, sap._
Air distributes the seeds of names.
Windflower, digitalis. Tipsy and ethereal.
Trade winds, vital light. Seeds within seeds.

•

_Start from the soil, and win their airy way._
The fifty-seeded heart’s delight, saturnine
and doting wild. Heart’s-ease. Herb constancy.
 _Pensée_     ...    An opening. Call-me-to-you. Kiss-her-
in-the-buttery. Meet-me-in-the-entry.



7



The yard wants what the yard wants.
_Rose_
Bloom of Ruth. Breath of life. Blush.
Charisma. Compassion. Imagination.
Ebb Tide and Nostalgia. Ground cover
and climbers. Floribunda. Abundance.


•

A hybrid of bruise and steep, petal and dreg.
Lungfuls of lamp flower, rose campion,
rose of heaven. The moon shoulders roseroot,
rosy-colored stonecrop. The neck laced with
French rose, common rose, pomander of roses.

•

At the center of the garden the heart.
 _Red as any rose_. Pulsing
balloon vine. Love in a puff.
Heartseed, heart-of-the-earth.
A continuous flow of red.



8



Nosebleed, staunchweed, sanguinary.
_List_
Thousand-leaved root of yellow.
Thousand weed with leaves like feathers.
Small birds flirt herb-of-Venus’ tree.
_If my love love me_ , nosebleed and yarrow.


•

Feverfew-profuse June and July.
Agueweed, sweating-plant,
boneset with yellow thrum.
Venus yields to water.
Boneset breaks the sun.

•

Past mudwalls and molehills,
where the cowslips and the lungs moss,
hedge bells, morning glory and the hundred-leaved
rose, all the livelong organs rose —
a catalogue, a desire, a wish.



9



Chaffweed whups the chin-cough.
_Life everlasting_
Venus hiccups dry wind and sandy rows.
The garden ruminates cudweed,
creeping roots June through September.
Pearl-flowered. Eternal flower.


•

Take flower-gentle.
Take knitbone and knitback.
Ass ear. Blackwort. Slippery root.
Saturn’s orbit comfrey-picked and sea-goat-prickly.
Take sea wrack, knobbed wrack, bladderwrack.

•

Paralysis and palsywort the garden
supplants fool’s parsley with imperatives!
 _Forget-me-not. Forget-me-not. Forget-me-not._
Mouse-ear to the ground. Borage for courage.
Self-heal. All-heal. By crook or by hook-heal.



10



_La voilà!_ Horsetail and paddock-pipes.
_Viola organista_
A hurdy-gurdyish drone.
Pansy-meek with cattail and fretted tension.
(Love-in-idleness.)
The over-thinking viola.


•

Liverwort, liverleaf, liverweed. A low sun
and Jupiter presumes three-lobed hepatica.
Water hectors wind and wind blows sound
into lungwort, bladderwort, kidneywort,
the kidney-leaved sower weed, the hartwort.

•

_Dame de coeur_. The crowning heart.
The garden wants it all: leaf, stem, root,
the whole shooting match shoot system,
timbre, pitch, fully chromatic rows,
heart trefoil and arssmart under sun.
