# Definitive Bright Morning
## Sy Hoahwah
Noted to be the definitive bright morning of 10,000 calendars.

The church bell melted.

Rage of unrequited love became a terrible serpent.

The morning star lowered like an enemy’s flag.

A vampire’s mattress tumbled out at the outskirts of town.

Ancient lanterns, suddenly thrown through the air,

somewhere deep in the mountains.

That night, in a snowy rural area, an elderly, powder-faced woman

appeared on doorsteps in search of wine.

Her origins, neatly wrapped in the cold dressing of a snowflake’s breath.
