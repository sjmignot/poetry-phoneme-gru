# Care
## Rae Armantrout
Dress like you care!
Eat like you care!
Care like you care!

You don’t think
apples just grow on trees,
do you?

•

A fish taps a clam
against a bony knob
of coral
to crack its shell —

which demonstrates intelligence
yes, but
is the fish
pleased with itself?

•

Alone in your crib,
you form syllables.

Are you happy when one
is like another?

Add yourself
to yourself.

Now you have someone.
