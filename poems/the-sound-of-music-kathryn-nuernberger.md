# The Sound of Music
## Kathryn Nuernberger
When I tell you I love
the song “Edelweiss”
you have to understand
that even though I too
am a sophisticate
who scorns musicals,
I was once a little girl
who stood in my grand-
father’s living room
singing, _Cuckoo!_
 _Cuckoo!_ while he sipped
his scotch and laughed
at my preciosity.
And when I sing the lyrics
in your ear— _Small and_
 _bright, clean and white,_
 _you look happy to meet me_
 _—_ you have to understand
my grandfather only ever
had one friend, a jeweler
who also drank scotch,
and left his $10,000 Rolex
to my grandfather, who
wore it even though
it turned his wrist green,
wore it to the funeral,
where the daughter sang
in her ethereal voice. _Blossom_
 _of snow may you bloom_
 _and grow, bloom and grow_
 _forever._ She couldn’t take
her eyes off the casket.
You have to understand that
my grandfather kept spinning
that heavy gold around
his wrist, and when he raised
his voice to join in, he cried
to sing it. _Edelweiss, edelweiss,_
 _bless my homeland forever._
