# From "Civil Bound"
## Myung Mi Kim


habitation, wooden crate in a nameless territory





dented objects for gathering water

plastic footwear two sizes too small, how the cracked heels hang over










the vine suggests sweet potato but notice the cradle of thorns












skiff ferry            militarized






eradication’s resourcefulness speaking in a high prestige language







jaundice shade of bombardment
singed skin grapheme







between ribs     what might be shale







the mother who isn’t
the father who isn’t







ramshackle peony
meridian bit in the mouth
