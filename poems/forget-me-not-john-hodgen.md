# Forget-Me-Not
## John Hodgen
My brother is dying and I am not.
I drag him behind me like a spiritless balloon, like the first robot,
like the last clown-car clown, his ridiculous Fiat, his lot
to be crushed, left for dead, covered in snot,
his puffy hands, his outsized shoes, his flower pot,
like Virgil Earp, Clanton-ganged, at the Not
OK Corral, un-brothered, gutshot,
like the night without sleep in Turandot.

From the get-go I have always sought
to know (what, _what?_ ) if this is all I’ve got,
to show up in a vestibule, all bothered and hot,
like silver-fingered Iscariot,
like the smiling highwayman, _tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot_ ,
while all about me are consigned to slather and rot.
I drink to my faith, to what I am not,
to all who’ve come before me, every rutty Lancelot,
every Huguenot, every hotsy-totsy hot to trot, every Dylan, besot,
who doesn’t have the strength to get up and take another shot.
I know my Morse, code blue, _dot-dot-dot, dit-dit-dit, dot-dot-dot_.
I know what God hath wrought.
