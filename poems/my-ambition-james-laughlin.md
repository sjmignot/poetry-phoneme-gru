# My Ambition
## James Laughlin
For Wade Hall
is to become a footnote
in a learned work of the

22nd century   not just a
“cf” or a “see” but a sol-

id note such as Raby gives
Walafrid Straho in _Christ-
_

ian Latin Poetry or Ernst
Robert Curtius (the most

erudite German who ever
lived) devotes to Alber-

tino Mussato in his _Euro-
_
p _ä_ _ische Literatur und La-
_

teinisches Mittelalter   I
hope the scholar of the

22nd will lick his schol-
arly lips when he finds me

in some forgotten source
(perhaps the _Obloquies_ of

Dreadful Edward Dahlberg)
and think here is an odd-
ball I would have liked,
immortalizing me in six

turgid lines of footnote.
