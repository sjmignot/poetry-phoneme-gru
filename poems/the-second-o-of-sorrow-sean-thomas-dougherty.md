# The Second O of Sorrow
## Sean Thomas Dougherty
Somehow, I am still here, long after
transistor radios, the eight-tracks my father blared

driving from town to town across Ohio
selling things, the music where we danced

just to keep alive. I now understand I was not
supposed to leave so soon, half a century

a kind of boulder that I’ve pushed up the hill
& now for a moment, like Sisyphus

I watch it roll.
I walk through the snow.

I breathe the dirty East Side wind
pushing past the Russian church, the scent

of fish & freighters & the refinery
filling the hole in my chest—how many years

have piled since I last stumbled out onto the ice
& sat down to die.

Only to look up at the geometry
of sky—& stood

to face whoever might need me—
