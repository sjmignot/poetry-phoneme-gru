Listen, Sanoe
Dewy _lehua_ bud
Here I am
Waiting for your voice.

The answer comes
I am satisfied
Softly, sweetheart
You excite my whole being.

My body is waiting
Waiting there in yearning belief
How are we to fulfill
The desire of our thoughts?

Calling to you, my water lily
Budding for the two of us
Here close by is a compliment
The _manu_ comes to deliver.

The Queen is listening
The aroma of the scents comes together
Mixes and rises upward
So similar, so alike.
