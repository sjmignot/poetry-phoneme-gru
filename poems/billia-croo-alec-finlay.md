culture is richest where there’s
the greatest ratio
land : coast

_— After Barry Cunliffe_

•



this patch of the western
ocean’s coruscating garden

recalls my favorite song
(mishearing) _the sea’s very hum-
_

drum ... — but no, there’s not
 _one_ ocean, not when such an

infinite mix of blues can
outshine the map’s cerulean


•



the sea is there for a solan
to push his wings against

or plunge in, reinventing
the medium — when the light

comes right through them
the waves let slip wrack

and tangle, pitching round
until they go breaking on

the boulder beach, crashing
under Row Head, hassling

brittlestars and urchins, or splash
near the shelducks dozing

on their green sun shelf —
there’s no need to worry

that any wave is wasted
when there’s all this motion


•



along the bay there’s
the promise of a new world

from each new device connect-
ed to the cable that runs

out under the wild rocks,
into the diamond space

inside those three buoys —
this is where the metal

gets salt-wet: and that’s
the only true test — the problem

is elastic: what kind of roots
will grip fast with moorings

subject to ebb, flood, flux,
in a surge of such force?


•



what’s solid was once liquid
as with rock and sand

which nature divided —
like us — these waves were

tugged and formed, in
slowness, slowness that

we’ve lost, for there’s no
way to relearn the tide’s

happy knack of infinitesimal
growth, except by sloshing

around, or waiting, stranded,
on the heave of the moon
