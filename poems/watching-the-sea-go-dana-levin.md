# Watching the Sea Go
## Dana Levin
               Thirty seconds of yellow lichen.

Thirty seconds of coil and surge,
               fern and froth, thirty seconds
                                of salt, rock, fog, spray.

Clouds

moving slowly to the left—

               A door in a rock through which you could see

                                            __

another rock,
                                laved by the weedy tide.

               Like filming breathing—thirty seconds

of tidal drag, fingering
               the smaller stones
                                down the black beach—what color

               was that, aquamarine?
Starfish spread

                                their salmon-colored hands.

                                            __


               I stood and I shot them.

I stood and I watched them
               right after I shot them: thirty seconds of smashed sea
                                while the real sea

                                thrashed and heaved—

               They were the most boring movies ever made.
I wanted

                                to mount them together and press Play.

                                            __


               Thirty seconds of waves colliding.
Kelp

               with its open attitudes, seals
                                riding the swells, curved in a row

                                just under the water—

                                                 the sea,

               over and over.
                                                 Before it's over.
