      to be
                              gone a
                  constant desire
         embarrassed for the
   giant leaning in for love
   we had enough
of
   the dance number but                   the whirling begins
  it just starts
  silos full of air
  no more corn
  no more wheat
 watching myself for
 full details in a strange man’s pants
 we let
            the soldier board the plane
              shot in head three days later
               why are you angry you said
                 why are you not I said
