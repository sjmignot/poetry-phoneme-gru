Cherub-bee-dee how does a man
who doesn’t read English well know that cherub-bee-dum
those aren’t really words-bee-dee.
But birds.

Cherub-bee-dum, he stumbles, reading to me
by the sliding glass door cherub-bee-dee, through which I watch
my brother play in the dum-dum-yard.

Cherub-bee-dee, cherub-bee-dum, like how my father says
 _Fine then! Leave!_ My mother shouts, _Stupid! Dumb!_
We live in a small bee-dee-nest too, one hallway to bee-dum-slam doors.

Birds? What are birds?
Thanks to my father, reading with me, I have more feathers.

T-H-E. First word he ever taught me to pluck    ...
 _It is a word used all the time_. Cherub-cherub-bee-dum!

 _The_ mail. _The_ mailbox. _The_ school bus. _The the_.

He asks me to read the mail. Not birds, _mail_.
If you don’t read this, you will turn into birds.
And I read it to him the best I can.
The end. A feather. Two feathers. The. The end.

Mother, mother. Repeat after me.
Cherub-bee-dee, cherub-bee-dum!
We read together before bedtime.
