# Portrait in the Form of Ephemera
## Mary Jo Bang
Three items in an envelope. A photograph of two, four, six, eight, nine boys
boarding a bus. Not boys, men. Dressed in the long wool coat of winter.
Something “based on the life of.” What can a moment outlast? That question
becomes a theory, theorem, mechanism. Three boys, one girl, a tree brushing
back air off her forehead. Paper, six clean sheets, a monogrammed envelope. An
index. The physical bias to existence becomes some wedge, the inexact value of
an empire of ether. Tick-tick. The amphibian emerges from water, walks off
stage. It’s as if evolution is embodied in absence. Someone is lying on her
back. She turns over. Her breath is in the air. Or in the idea of atmosphere.
