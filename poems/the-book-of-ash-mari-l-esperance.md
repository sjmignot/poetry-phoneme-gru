# The Book of Ash
## Mari L'Esperance
Near the end of my searching
               I came to a door.

Entering, I found the story
               of her life, laid out like a cake

on an ebony table, as if waiting there
               for the lost bride—pages flat

and placid, blank as a lake
               asleep in winter. Hoping

for answers, some knowledge of her,
               perhaps—I’m not sure what—

I placed my palm upon the surface.

It sank through and disappeared
               beneath a cloud of snowy powder.
