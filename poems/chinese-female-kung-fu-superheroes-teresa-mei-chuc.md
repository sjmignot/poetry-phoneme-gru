are real. They jump from roof-top
to roof-top, do a backward flip
down to the concrete floor and land
perfectly on two feet.

The metal of swords clang,
the body moves with the precision
of a praying mantis striking
its prey.

Their dresses are colorful, long
and lacy, billow and flair
with each turn and twist.

Jewelry in the hair dangles and sparkles.

Chinese female kung-fu superheroes
are smart, fight bad guys, do good deeds,
and risk their lives.

never give up. They travel often alone
by foot through mountains. They work hard
training to master various martial arts forms.

They do not care about Barbies,
those plastic dolls of only one hair color
that just looked pretty in the 80's. They aren't
impressed; they do not want a boring life.

Chinese female kung-fu superheroes venture out
and save cities against villains. They steal into the night
in their black ninja-like suits, soundlessly through a house
to recover a magical sword and to release a prisoner,
knowing exactly where to press with their two fingertips
to freeze the guards and to accomplish their mission.
