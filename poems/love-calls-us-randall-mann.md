# Love Calls Us
## Randall Mann
_The soul descends once more in bitter love …_
                                                                          --Richard Wilbur

The eyes
open to the cries
of police.

Skirting sleep,
the soul
industrial

as laundry—
realities
like bad checks,

burning
like new sex.
Dinner

is the better half
of someone’s
lunch. Someone’s

playing
a guessing
game:

Psychosis
or Handsfree.
Local fame.

Praying
to a calf,
or debt ceiling,

keeps
us grounded.
You can take

the kid
out the food court,
but child support

won’t upgrade
from buy
to buy—

outbid,
I am my
financial aide.

Astounded,
we wake
and take.

Let every boy
Tolstoy
with disease

have a chance.
Liabilities,
let’s dance.

We’re clean—
or rather, not
unclean—

doxycycline
our balance
sheet.

Our spirits, neat.
