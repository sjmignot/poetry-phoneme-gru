# For the Dogs Who Barked at Me on the Sidewalks in Connecticut
## Hanif Abdurraqib
Darlings, if your owners say you are / _not usually like this_ / then I must
take them / at their word / I am like you / not crazy about that which towers
before me / particularly the buildings here / and the people inside / who look
at my name / and make noises / that seem like growling / my small and eager
darlings / what it must be like / to have the sound for love / and the sound
for fear / be a matter of pitch / I am afraid to touch / anyone who might stay
/ long enough to make leaving / an echo / there is a difference / between
burying a thing you love / for the sake of returning / and leaving a fresh
absence / in a city’s dirt / looking for a mercy / left by someone / who came
before you / I am saying that I / too / am at a loss for language / can’t beg
myself / a doorway / out of anyone / I am not usually like this either / I
must apologize again for how adulthood has rendered me / us, really  / I know
you all forget the touch / of someone who loves you / in two minutes / and I
arrive to you / a constellation of shadows / once hands / listen darlings /
there is a sky / to be pulled down / into our bowls / there is a sweetness for
us / to push our faces into / I promise / I will not beg for you to stay this
time / I will leave you to your wild galloping / I am sorry / to hold you
again / for so long / I am in the mood / to be forgotten.
