# Unknown Sun
## Laura Moriarty
"light which is not sum" --Norma Cole, Mars
The workaround or aura
Not like repetition

When we get to the final sun
The maps are water the water gold

He would not honor me
You explain then against

The disbelief displayed by the character
I couldn’t know him

But knew love and
Know it through knowledge

“Love never falls off whether prophecies
will be abolished whether tongues stopped”

Announced as the fact
Redolent of what was

The defining addition
More than the parts

Unprecedented
Ardor also not

Adding up to
Sun or son to sum

The outcome
Unknowable

Perfect and
Unavowed

The same sound
Unknown sum
