## Melissa Stein
I want to write my lover a poem
but a very bad one. It'll include
a giant squid and some loose change

and cuff links and two blue ferries chugging
headfirst on the East River at twenty-six knots
and only at the last minute averting

disaster through quick thinking and sure reflexes. Also
a bow and arrow and glossy red apple
I perch in front of my heart. To be honest

my lover doesn't really like poetry,
which I guess is why I plan to write
such a bad one, so he can feel right

and strong and good in his beliefs.
Tonight when I go see my lover
he’ll hold me as I've never been held

except by him and then I'll have to give him
back. When you get new things
you treat them like glass for a while

and then get used to them
and manhandle them
like everything else.

I don't want to give him back
but partly it's not up to me and
partly I don't want to be his

old sofa. I want to radiate and gleam
arrestingly until the certain, premature
end. You can compose a whole life

out of these rollercoasters.
You can be everywhere
and nowhere, over and over

life slapping you in the face
 till you’re newly burnished
flat-out gasping and awake.
