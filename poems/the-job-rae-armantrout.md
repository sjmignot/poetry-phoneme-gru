# The Job
## Rae Armantrout
Attending to verbal constructs
makes care long-term,
not acute,

which is for the best
because, though flawed,
each one is salvageable

or replaceable
unlike my flesh.
Words can be compared

with moments,
houses, trees, wires,
wires, trees, houses.

All stand
on their marks.
Still,

thereâ€™s a lot of overlap.
I move my eyes
to make time.

I take their measure
and create a duplicate.
