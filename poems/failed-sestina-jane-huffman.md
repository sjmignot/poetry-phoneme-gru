# Failed Sestina
## Jane Huffman
With my ear to the door
of my cell. And my want
like a comb in my hair.

Like a veil where there is no
veil. With a ring in my ear.
A ring in the hole in my ear.

I rap at the door of my will
and the door of my want
as to will them away. My

want like a veil on the floor.
I appear at the door of my
will with a veil in my hand

and a comb in my hair.
My want like a hole that
I bore in the floor.

Where my will is more
feeling than veil, and my veil
is more want for a veil

than a veil. I wear the comb
of my fear in my hair.
My veil is as thin as my want,

and my want is as thin
as a hair. When I curl up my
want in the curl of my hair.

When I curl up on the floor
of the cell of my want.
I bear my fear in my cells

like I’m bearing a ring.
Like I’m curled up inside
of the ring in my ear.

I rap at my want for a door
where there is no door.
A will where there is no will.

At my want for unveiling.
My will to unveil it. The curve
of my will and my ear

to the door. With the curl
of my ear to the door. Not
the door but my fear of the door.
