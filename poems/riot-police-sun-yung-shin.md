This is you—Titanus giganteus, your maw snapping pencils in half and cutting
through human flesh. My encyclopedia chokes on your bulk. My camera, timid,
afraid to look, as if you’re naked—not one adult male, but millions.

Few garments sound as fine as _flak jacket,_ the best of the tagmata the
thorax, more prime than brains as the body can keep mating, cracking its
margins. Your shield like a wing, protects your bulletproof heart from the
wind, your right arm black in the cloth of your brothers. Full face visor.
Baby gladiator.

Beyond the screen, memorized—jawbone like a scandal reflecting all the thieves
and beggars. Insect lord, insect mind. This is my fear. You look like my
brother, my son. You could kill me with your looks.
