1.

 Always, they begin
as units of prayer

in sleep
watery images

then I wake
seeing them

crowded together
in a headline

 _Officers in Bronx Fire 41 Shots,_
 _And an Unarmed Man Is Killed_

this lacerated tongue
thirsts to remember

the names of all the faces
hidden behind the barrel of a gun

loaded blasted
into national memory

becoming caesuras.

Each name is
a body craving
wholeness.


2.

These eyes shutter
imagining

a different script
playing out behind their lids.


3.

When I wake tomorrow
Let there be a riot of birds

outside my window
Let there be crows

flying South in horseshoe formation
Let there be Peruvian musicians

with their wooden flutes
& African drummers

& children double-dutching
over liberated firehydrants

Let there be Nina Simone’s
“Mississippi Goddamn” remixed

Let these words serve
a different master/narrative

Let sound shoot outside this mouth
echoing in every

walk home
dark alley
(neighbor)hood

May this poem
lodge inside your breast.
