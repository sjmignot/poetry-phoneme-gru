# "A snake eats a mynah"
## Sharmistha Mohanty
A snake eats a mynah
head first, yellow legs extend
from the snakeâ€™s filled mouth
The cattle bellow
tethered to ancient trees
Dung fills the tall grass
Thunder strikes at the humid air
There is no I
in the breath
Roots wind through fallen leaves
The terror of an owl smashes
into a tree trunk
loses a wing
drops below into dried weeds
There is no I
in the breath
The seasons are muscular and original
What should I
speak
Thunder strikes again and again
What is real must be harvested
each day and threshed and ground
put through fire
then eaten
What should I
imagine
in this place where we become
Our sight is made from our seasons
Bring us
the rain
