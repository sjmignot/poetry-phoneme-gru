# Imagine

The healer said to me: _it worked because you thought it would_. I
let him palm my belly and chest; sometimes he shook and
closed his eyes. Inches above my skin, he'd sweep his hands like
smoothing sheets I couldn't see. I left our bed for years when I
was sick. I understood our children then: bed meant missing out;
bed felt like punishment. Now I sleep best at the edge—where
the healer sat to rest. Your hand reaches for my hip, holds on. Our
children's mouths sigh open in the dark. They're not surprised:
the healer touched me, and it worked. They've seen magicians —
beneath the sheet that's pulled away, something's always gone.
