In Exodus
Moses is hidden

in a cleft, behind God’s hand,
begging,

and he sees — rushing past him —
God’s back, diminishing.

Moses stops begging.
God’s back is black fog.

I know. He, we guess,
means to do it,
to do all of this.

The brute center part
of an iridescent moth.

The carnation
against the man.
