# Two Guardians
## Roberto Tejada
My words were sent underground to where the toggle switch detonates.
That was the glare our voices were avoiding. There was something also


broken about the obedience of this retainer. The arcades weren’t
semaphores just because the arrows leading there facilitated those


of us in line as though reliant on east or west quadrants. The ticket
master was prone to elide requests from the travelers, the sliding doors


sounded a fanfare for the common man, get faster as thought, or mind
the gaps. What I infer can never altogether establish a space adequate


to the body count. The platform motivates two guardians who were
instructed in safekeeping to usher me from harm’s way but my stand


point so recedes from this tableaux as to acknowledge a footprint
perspective. Translucent envelope inside remaindered by the riptide


or such tunnel vision as to warrant arrest. Why I was sent to the nether
world inflicted with no wound. Someone lets fall a pair of zip locks


containing the pixie sticks of this conspiracy; what I had to say was
sent, I mentioned this I think already, underground switch and toggle


intended to ignite what I could never bring myself to mean. Where
the voices were avoiding me—hands outstretched at quarter day to hold


back the beam—was there something broken? I weather compliant. I rally.
