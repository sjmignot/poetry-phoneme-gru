# Poem
## Claudia La Rocco
For js
You were laughing no you weren't she was she was she wasn't
These aren't the right words

The people are waiting on the platform and the decisions are being themselves
as usual
You could take this silver cord and wrap it around all of your ideas
You could you could
What is the way to make meaning
You're less busy than the machine has time for

I poured the world in for you
All the sun on that block
Or at least I wanted to:
Everyone is leaving but this would be an arrival your torso is a drum people
come through and then they die you see the obituary in passing as the man next
to you folds the paper and all these people at all these parties that cannot
be the answer but what

Back above ground and it's the same sun different block same world different
world

Your friend is lying down with the thing he is carrying
Everybody is somebody's family you think you forget the sun keeps going still
you keep going the world rearranges itself just so
False alarm you say and then you don't know what to say you wrap yourself in
the future you wrap yourself in the past the woman gets in the taxi just in
time

Everybody is it's not an easy thing to understand
False alarm you say and then you don't know what to say the sun keepsÂ  going.
