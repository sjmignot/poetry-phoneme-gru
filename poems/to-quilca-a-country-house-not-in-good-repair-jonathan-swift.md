# To Quilca, a Country House not in Good Repair
## Jonathan Swift
Let me thy Properties explain,
A rotten Cabin, dropping Rain;
Chimnies with Scorn rejecting Smoak;
Stools, Tables, Chairs, and Bed-steds broke:
Here Elements have lost their Vses,
Air ripens not, nor Earth produces:
In vain we make poor _Sheelah_ toil,
Fire will not roast, nor Water boil.
Thro' all the Vallies, Hills, and Plains,
The Goddess _Want_ in Triumph reigns;
And her chief Officers of State,
_Sloth_ , _Dirt_ , and _Theft_ around her wait.
