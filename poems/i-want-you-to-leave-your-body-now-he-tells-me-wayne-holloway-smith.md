# "I want you to leave your body now" he tells me
## Wayne Holloway-Smith
his voice not so much hypnotic as reaching
 _for_ the hypnotic

but I leave it anyway sitting in the upright chair
of the windowless room

for a place higher up that’s not quite
the windowless room—

though I’m aware of my body’s particular kind
of breathing down there

dressed in my favorite shirt and somehow
up here I’m dressed

in that same shirt which is I feel suddenly
becoming very important

its color pertaining to a quiet hue of knowing
I can’t quite explain

and I do not think about the money I have
given him the man who is speaking

but I’m looking instead down on a yellow
kitchen in Swindon

upon a tiny remembered body I have found
crying or about to cry

in little white shorts and there is carpet
streaked with blue

and there is the noise of a terrible thing
that is happening

and there is summer outside with its
other children

“He doesn’t understand does he”
says the man

“he is so young” and I understand the shirt
that he will have to grow through

all of the terrible things to fit
I can feel my body now

filling up the space inside its soft and
lavender-scented cotton
