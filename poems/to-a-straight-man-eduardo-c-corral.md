# To a Straight Man
## Eduardo C. Corral
All zodiac all
radar your voice
I carried it
across the Atlantic
to Barcelona
I photographed
cathedrals
cacti mosaic
salamanders
I even photo-
graphed my lust
always
your voice skimming
a womanâ€™s skin
mattress springs
so noisy so birdlike
you filled her room
with cages
camera bright
in my pocket map
unfolding
in my mind
I explored a park
leaves notched
& enormous
graffitied boulders
then
three men

tall & clean
closed in
they broke open
my body
with their fists
insufferable
your red wool cap
insufferable the way
you walked
away from me
come back please
the buttons
on your jacket
are finches
I wanted to yell
as you vanished
into a hotel
to drink with
your friends
there was nothing
more
you could do
after my attackers left
before I got up
I touched my face
almost tenderly
