# The Door
## Debra Nystrom
She never said _I’m going to die._ I was with her nearly
every minute that week, reading, sleeping on the cot beside

the high-tech bed that kept shifting her slight weight
while the window shadowed over, then grew brighter,

and she drifted or got changed or was given another
shot. None of us said it, though finally when

she was barely talking anymore, I asked something like _Mom,_
 _are you ready?—I just want Brad to be ok_ was what

she replied. I told her he would be, as if her wish
or mine could preside at his sentencing hearing.

After that she was almost entirely silent, but when Dad
came the last afternoon, edgy without a cigarette,

checking over the monitors, Mom said she wanted to see him
for a while alone, and he was startled. _Pull the door_

 _closed_ , I heard her tell him, and he did. Out in the hall,
staring at the pattern of alternating tiles, I thought of Saturday

mornings when Brad and I were little, and Dad and Mom’s
room would be not just shut for a time, but locked. Secretly

I tried the knob once. In that house nobody was allowed
to lock a door but Dad. Grandma would shoo us to the TV

with cinnamon toast to watch cartoons, one fool panic after
the next—bolted dungeons, lies and threats, a saw-blade

inching toward the tied-up body. Then real people like us,
finally: Roy Rogers saving them with his amazing calm.
