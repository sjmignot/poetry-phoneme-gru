# Tiger on the Shoulder
## Janet McAdams
We didn’t know my mother was driving
back to her childhood, with a ring
of keys, a compass, and a tiger

panting in the back seat. Soon enough
the tiger was behind the wheel, circling.
And each circle spun further and

further away from us. When she calls,
the tiger has parked the yellow-striped taxi
on the highway’s rough shoulder. It’s time,

she says, for this dream to be over. Time
to go home, sleep in her own bed.
If the compass ever worked, she’s forgotten

how to read it, and the ring for the keys
is broken, the keys melted down
for their metal. If I would just _call someone_

and tell him where she is. She has money —
she can pay someone to drive her home.
If only a road sign were in sight, but no, there’s

only scattered chert and farmland
and a man across the road who is not my father.
Behind the wheel the hungry tiger’s

yellow eyes are slightly open. Behind the wheel
the tiger snacks on the summer of 1970 and
the entire works of Iris Murdoch.

Caught in his teeth are recipes for chocolate mousse
and coq au vin, my brother’s first arrest, the one-
room schoolroom where her mother taught.

So who to call? The tiger, sated for the nonce,
has started snoring. The quick drive by,
today disguised as children. The tiger snores away.
