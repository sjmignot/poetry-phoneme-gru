# Hidden
## James McMichael
      In dogma
is the secret that renders God unconditioned,

on one condition.
“If you are not My people,
I am not your God.”
As fashioned by His people's witness,

a made thing,
God,
condemns the made things graven

images are. Inscribed as born

wittingly of Himself,
God is
(so to speak)
that Father
abler than the most sovereign

earthly father to make
all things good.
God the Father is conceived as

for us.
Purposive,
stewarding,
benign,

He covenants our living on.
“Written in

continuance” in His Book
before they took form
were the parts of our fitful bodies.
As if what's
given with the world is

life only,

life,
and not
(along with it,
in time) at last, life's needful withdrawal,

God's said to let the truthful
keep their lives forever if they swear God
does what He says.
These are the portions: either
I'll outlast death

or it me.
Little matter which

if it's the avowed

God I'm given up to.
That I'm settled in the finite is what's true instead.
Living is a good I don't want stopped

even for the saved.
I'm beholden to it all the way that,
in its one chance each with me and others,
death hasn't used itself
up yet. Mine affords me another day

hours before it's light. Along with the caused
things outside that I can't see, I'm here
ahead of myself again
toward that coupling with the ground

when “I am poured out like water.”
Death's still to be heard from at its least reserved.
Under its breath it primes me to pay up and look pleasant.
