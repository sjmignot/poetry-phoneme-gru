In the end, some are incurable. They use lint to
mop up the leaking, or apply cold poultices.

Creeping mess can be cleared up with pink paste or
trapped in sawdust and swept.

Blood can pool from their sitting and standing, but
they avoid clots by regular shaking, and the
sucking of sherbet.

Blue blue for the sky, white for the walls, apricot
for glass and woodwork.

They devise a timetable by casting lots. They
scrabble around in the dirt for clues.

Seven is too magical a number to hold, but the soft
ones like to handle it constantly.

They polish its fine teak head, drive theories
through its shaft and talk into the early hours

about how it can resemble an ax, or sex, and how
it solves, as well as creates, all conundr/ums/a.

They admire their creosoted fence for protection
and their own faces in its misaligned hasp.

A Mrs. Milkwater puts baby brushes to soak in milk
and water (and vinegar). Her sons are successful
barbers.

At precisely midnight the blue lights go out. The
red lights stay home.
