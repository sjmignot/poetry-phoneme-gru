# alleyway
## Aziza Barnes
As fresh garbage is. As dirt sucked out of a fingernail. As a wall clean of
prostitutes. When I am this I am at the mercy of my nakedness. A pillar of
undress whose power I do not know how to wield. I watch porn. I study the
geometry of limbs splayed. Not the moan but the angle of a moan. I swallow. In
this way I am a thief. Sometimes I forget my body & go untouched until I am
touched & scream. Sometimes I want to eat my breasts down to their bitter rind
& spit them out. I want to be the bitter rind without suck and easily thrown.
Easily thrown I want to be the pebble thumbed & wished upon before enveloping
the lake I sink in. I sink in you the lake & by lake I mean gutter a water
that does not hold me well. Here we are not the bodies our mothers made. If
you are to hold me hold me as a gun. Grip me & profit the dark. The unattended
purse. The pair of heels darting from us in dull claps sharpening against the
concrete as teeth against a stone.
