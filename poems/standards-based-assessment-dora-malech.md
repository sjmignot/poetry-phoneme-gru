# Standards-Based Assessment
## Dora Malech
I.

Nothing _happened_ here.
Meaning it was _done_.

 _Over_ counts itself among
the studied synonyms

but beyond
those round mouths

opening for answers
 _done_ is the opposite of _over_.


II.

What is the sum
when you add

cut flowers in cellophane
to teddy bears and prayers

and the difference
when you take away

and take away
and take away?

Show your work.
 _Attend to precision_.


III.

The students are gone.
It is not summer.

The classroom snake
that fled its shattered tank

the long shadows
draping themselves over

the overturned desks
and the red pen fallen

to the floor will count
as symbols on a different

subject test. Let them be
innocent in this world.
