# Safe
## Steven Huff
You used to be able to flag a ride in this country.
Impossible now—everyone is afraid
of strangers.   Well, there was fear then too,
and it was mutual: drivers versus hitchhikers.
And we rode without seat belts,
insurance or beliefs.  People
would see me far ahead on a hill like a seedling,
watch me grow in the windshield
and not know they were going to stop until
they got right up to me.  Maybe they wanted
company or thought I’d give them
some excitement.  It was the age
of impulse, of lonesome knee jerks.  An old woman
stopped, blew smoke in my face
and after I was already in her car she asked me
if I wanted a ride.  I’m telling you.
Late one night a construction boss pulled over.
One of his crew had been hit
by the mob, he said as he drove, distraught
and needing to talk to someone.
We rode around for a long time.
He said, _I never wore a gun to a funeral before_ ,
_but they’ve gotta be after me too_.
Then he looked at me and patted the bulge
in his coat.  _Don’t worry_ , he said, _you’re safe_.
