## Danez Smith
you save me half a bag of skins, the hard parts, my fav, dusted orange with
hot


•


you say we can’t go to the bar cause you’re taking your braids out
i come over, we watch madea while we pull you from you


•


you make us tacos with the shells i like & you don’t


•


i get too drunk at the party, you scoop my pizza from the sink with a solo
cup, all that red


•


you, in the morning, bong water grin, wet chin


•


you, in the lawless dark, laughing like a room of women laugh
at a man who thinks his knowledge is knowledge


•


i text you & you say, _i was bout to text you, bitch_


•


you cook pork chops same way i do, our families in another city go to the same
church


•


you, rolling a blunt, holding your son, is a mecca


•


you invite me out for drag queens on the nights i think of finally [ ]


•


you pull over in Mississippi so i can walk a road my grandfather bled on


•


you gave me a stone turtle, it held your palm’s scent for a week


•


i call your mama mama


•


you request like a demand, _make me some of that mango cornbread_
i cut the fruit, measure the honey


•


you & you & you & you go in on a dildo for my birthday
you name it drake, you know me


•


a year with you in that dirty house with that cracked-out cat was a good year


•


at the function, i feel myself splitting into too many rooms of static
you touch my hand & there i am


•


_do you want to be best friends?_
a box for yes, a box for no


•


did our grandmothers flee the fields of embers so we could find each other
here?
friend, you are the war’s gentle consequence


•


i am the prison that turns to rain in your hands


•


you, at my door the night my father leapt beyond what we know
you, dirt where i plant my light


•


the branches of silence are heavy with your sweet seed


•


you smell like the milk of whatever beast i am


•


your poop is news, your fart is news, your gross body my favorite song


•


you, drunk as an uncle, making all kinds of nonsense sense
i listen for the language between your words


•


& when we fight, not a ring, but a room with no exit
we spill the blood & bandage the wound, clean burns with our tongues


•


if luck calls your name, we split the pot
& if you wither, surely i rot


•


we hate the same people, we say _nigga please_ with the same mouth


•


& before we were messy flesh, i’m sure we were the same dust


•


everywhere you are is a church, & i am the pastor, the deacons, the mothers
fainting at the altar


•


as long as i am a fact to you, death can do with me what she wants


•


my body, water, your body, a trail of hands carrying the river to the sea


•


i ink your name into my arm to fasten what is already there


•


i would love you even if you killed god


•


you made coming out feel like coming in from the storm


•


you are the country i bloody the hills for


•


you love me despite the history of my hands, their mangled confession


•


at the end of the world, let there be you, my world


•


god bless you who screens all my nudes, drafts my break-up text


•


you are the drug that knocks the birds from my heart


•


ain’t no mountain, no valley, no river i wouldn’t give the hands for comin’ to
you sideways


•


o the horrid friends who were just ships harboring me to you


•


& how many times have you loved me without my asking?
how often have i loved a thing because you loved it?
including me


•


& i always knew


•


with yo ugly ass
