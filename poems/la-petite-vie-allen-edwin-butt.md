# La Petite Vie
## Allen Edwin Butt
Love is the kindest
expression
of absence—

Or else
is a day
by the river,

in which by
motion
it becomes clear—

there have been
in an hour an
infinite train

of rivers, _&_ which
did you want
to see? One

comes slowly
to realize
there is no evading things

(the heart will have
its way, though
its will go

unfulfilled),
_&_ there is no shame
in this.

The pleasures in this world—
soft breeze, soft
thighs, a bit of music,

words that make
a good sound—
suggest when taken

whole that the
thing
the body longs for

is not _&_ never has been
some _petite mort_ ,
a true thing

known to grass
_&_ the elderly man
with a kind word

in greeting. And
the woman saying
that she is about

to come, as in
_going to arrive_ —
at last to fill

the body held so long
by stewards
in her name.
