# If You're Crowish
## Wendy Videlock
If  you’re crowish and you know it
give a caw

 _Caaaw_

If  you’re weighted and you bear it
send a moo

 _Moooo_

If  you’re owl and you dreamed it,
give a hoo

 _Hoooo_

If  you’re thirsty and you mean it
breathe an ahhh

 _Ahhhh_

You are putty in my hands

said the wind

to the stone

said the dawn

to the bloom

said the dark

to the moon.
