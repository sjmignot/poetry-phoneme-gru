# Why I Am Not a Sculpture
## Jane Yeh
To be a statue               carved by Bernini
Lounging in a climate-controlled museum in Rome         is luxury
Like the luxury of a personal pan pizza            with unlimited free
toppings
Or the luxurious feel of a premium eye pencil          used to draw bisons on
the walls of a French cave
To be so white and glossy                   is unimaginable
Like how I imagine a plate of eggs painted by Velázquez           or the lid
of a designer toilet cistern
In a European magazine                       (I could be European
And wear a dashingly arranged scarf          or sip weirdly-named liqueurs
that taste like semen
In a Rococo _palais_ )                but in the scheme of things
Where I am marble and still                  my wrist will be a marvel
Like the marvel of an isthmus           whose name can only be pronounced if
you have a lisp
Or the marvelous sausage                that saved a man from the Inquisition
in 1582
It is definitely marvelous                    to be as attenuated
As the casually extended leg of a greyhound                   reclining on its
very own velvet settee
To be so thoroughbred                          is an accomplishment
Like the thoroughly flattened face of a Persian cat                   which
always looks peevish
Or the extremely frivolous ceiling                   of a banqueting hall
where royals are put to death
If it is admirable to be so luxurious                    then I will never be
admired
The way a designer toilet cistern is admired               or a piece of
elaborate pâtisserie
(Although I am not a statue                   I have often held my arms aloft
As when catching a carelessly thrown baby              or pointing at two
meteors at the same time)
It is exhausting trying to be so inanimate               and desirable
If my arm breaks off  like the shell                of a freshly-filled
cannoli
