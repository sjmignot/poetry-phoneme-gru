# Lullabies of Elsewhere
## Chase Twichell
_She was always elsewhere._

That’s what Mom wants
carved on her stone.

When did she first realize
there was an Elsewhere,
and that she was in it?

What baby songs did she
sing from wherever she was
down to me in my crib?

The lullabies of   Elsewhere.

On birthdays
she ﬁlled little ﬂowerpots
with chocolate ice cream

and a real zinnia,
chocolate jimmies for dirt.

I tasted the cold chocolate,
I opened the gifts.

If  they were real, I was real.
I was in the Elsewhere too.
