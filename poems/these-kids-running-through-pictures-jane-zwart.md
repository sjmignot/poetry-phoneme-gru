# These kids running through pictures
## Jane Zwart
before cameras could remember color, back when
the paint had not yet dried
on the world, and where was the fire? Everywhere
under their feet a patchy shining
and nothing tall standing plumb on either side
of the
street,
canted saplings
and slow ziggurats
in brick,
everything
splayed
away from     the kids   who wreck,
who make                 these pictures.

Their defenseless foreheads, the wet paving. Each cuts
their eyes at the adult who kneels, who stares
through a black birdhouse.

Their hurry does blur some things
on their way into the box: blousing coats
and bobbed hair, hungry auras. And something
without fail also is tucked
in the arm’s right angle: a ball, an orange,
an infant’s skull. They could not
strive more furiously
if it were an infant’s skull.
