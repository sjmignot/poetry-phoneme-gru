# Nemesis
## Emily Fragos
The old men with too much gamble in them, whose eyes

Are at peace only when all is lost, see the Queen's quiet face

On the deck of cards, the red cuff of  her cloak, the raw tip

Of  her tongue, the blood on her dress    . . .    What fled from them

In their frenzies comes tiptoeing back, choiring, to the marble

Concert hall where Nemesis, in velvet opera cape, is beginning

Her recitative: _it is your turn to go slowly now_ , _with hands_

_clasped behind your back_ , _drowsy from the earth's sweet_

_abundance and her great deprivations_ , _the rows of crooked trees_ ,

_the streets' bright monotony, and gather up the starving_ . . .
