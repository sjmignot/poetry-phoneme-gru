# A Brief Treatise on Etymology
## Eduardo Chirinos
If someone tells you that your poem is nostalgic,
take it as a compliment. There's no greater
praise. In Greek, _nostos_ means "return" and
 _algia_ "pain." What's a poem without the return
of pain?  If they tell you that your poem is
melancholic, take that as a compliment, too. In
Greek, _melan_ means "black" and _khole_ "bile."
What's a poem without the most pernicious disorder
of the body and soul?  Pain and illness.  If your
poem is nostalgic and melancholic, see a doctor.
