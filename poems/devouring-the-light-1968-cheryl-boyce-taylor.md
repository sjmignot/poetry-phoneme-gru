# Devouring the Light, 1968
## Cheryl Boyce-Taylor
After Martin Luther King Jr.
The day they killed Martin
we could not return to New York City
our visiting senior class stuck in Huntsville
streets blazed with suffering in that small
Alabama town
in the dull shroud of morning
the whole world went crazy
devouring whatever light
that lit our half-cracked windows.
