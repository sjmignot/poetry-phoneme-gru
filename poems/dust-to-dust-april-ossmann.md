# Dust to Dust
## April Ossmann
Nevermind that keeping ashes
     on the mantel feels ghoulish,
and comically impractical:

not just another thing,
     a miniature memento urn, to dust,
but dust to dust—

I dread the conversational
     Hara-kiri, not, _that’s what’s left_
 _of my brother,_ but, _he died of suicide_ :

the chasm of silence following the leap—
     so the cremains stay
in the office closet till they migrate

through no will of their own
     to a moving box
I haven’t unpacked and likely won’t.
