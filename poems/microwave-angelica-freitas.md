# microwave
## Angélica Freitas
how to explain brazil to an extraterrestrial:
your face on a flag. they’d recognize
you as leader
and knock you off. dirty
part of the conquest.
but it already happened, in another shape: aerial
view of the amazon,
a hundred-odd
hydroelectric plants
to fry your eggs in the microwave.
and they’d finish you off: just
part of the conquest.
and what if they came
to tour the waterfalls?
or to be taught by the elite
how to make a democracy?
the spaceships cover the sky
completely.
all the offices and fast food joints declare
an end to the working day.
cockroaches and rats
fled first.
it’s christmas, carnival, easter,
our lady of aparecida, and the final judgment
all at once.
lovers fuck for the last time.
atms dry heave.
the supermarket was a cemetery!
the malls, the freeways!
to explain civil unions
to an iguana, to explain
political alliances to a cat, to explain
climate change
to an aquarium turtle.
it’s done, already. now, wait.
eat an activia.
dwell in philosophy. imagine!
in our tropical country ... disastrous!
not one river more. tragic!
worse than locusts,
your marvelous hydroelectric plants will be
seen, in flames, from sirius:
“my country was a sweet corn _pamonha_
that a starving alien
put in the microwave.”
watch us burn:
possible epitaph.
