# Coexistence: A Lost and Almost Found Poem
## Peter Cole
And the Levites shall speak, and say
unto all the men of Israel, with a loud voice:
--Deuteronomy 27:14
Over the border the barrier winds,
devouring orchards of various kinds.

_Cursed be he that taketh away
_
          the landmark of his neighbor.
And all the people shall say, Amen.

The road was blocked in a battle of wills—
as the lame and sightless trudged through the hills.

_Cursed be he that maketh the blind
_
          to go astray in the way.
And all the people shall say, Amen.

The army has nearly written a poem:
You'll now need a permit just to stay home.

_Cursed be he that perverteth the justice
_
          due to the stranger (in Scripture).
And all the people shall say, Amen.

Taken away—in the dead of night—
by the secret policeman, who might be a Levite.

_Cursed be he that turneth to smite
_
          his neighbor in secret murder.
And all the people shall say, Amen—

as peace is sought through depredation,
living together in separation.

_Cursed be he that confirmeth not
_
          the words of this law—to do them.
And all the people shall say, Amen.
