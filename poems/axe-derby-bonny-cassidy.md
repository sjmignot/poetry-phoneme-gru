# Axe Derby
## Bonny Cassidy
Never were knuckle-men.
Choked up on planks

of smoke, they haul
towards the peplum: stabbing

back at time, splinters of it
flip like cars. Rolled sleeves,

knees cooked, the rousie
is flirting with her broom, a blonde

with criminal simplicity with
historical truth we can detoxify

a poisoned planet. Now
theyâ€™re descending the spirit heap;

dribbling pinkies along fair knotty thighs.
Children are returning to pick up the butts.

Still the brunette is caving in the face
of time, is making herself a living

treasure from this surplus
hour the minutes fly
