# Freedsong: Dream Song
## Tyehimba Jess
Our Box Henry hid    away.
John Berryman’s Ol’ Henry sulked.
I see his point—he was trying to put one over.
It was that he thought that we thought
he _could_ do it that breaks our Henry out this-a-way.
So, here he will come out and talk.

All the world like a fool-bent lover
once did see from Ol’ Henry’s side.
Here comes a departure:
hereafter, something falls out. Now, it might go fraught.
Let us see how Box Henry, pried
open for all to see, survives.

What he has now to say is a long
wonder the world can bear and see.
Once, with his black-face worn, John was glad
all at the top. And he sang.
Here, in this land where some strong be,
let Box Henry grow in every head.
