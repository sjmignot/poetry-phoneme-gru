# Staying Quiet
## Hieu Minh Nguyen
Once, a man named a thing _beautiful_ & so we wore it,
buried it, turned it into currency. Somewhere, maybe here, maybe now,
I stand completely still until he looks in my direction. Sometimes I don’t
believe I exist until someone calls me beautiful. Sometimes
any warm thing will do. Sometimes it’s me, a warm thing in the low
light. _Beautiful_ is what the man called me after he did
what he wanted with — I’m running out of ways to describe it
 — my body, my silence. Beautiful. Why, I ask, in order to love
yourself must you, first, be loved? A bone sucked clean
of its marrow. A trail of ants magnified into ash.  & of course,
I’m asking no one. & of course, I know the answer.
Of course, I know it’s not me they’re looking for, the men, I mean.
& I wished he didn’t feel the need to speak, really wished — like me
 — he just kept quiet, but no, he had to speak, he had to say _beautiful_  —
& now, goddamnit, my body appears, trapped in the long tunnel
of a telescope. & now I am here attending the aftermath
of my own ruin, with nothing but _beautiful_ to keep me company.
Maybe he meant the city beyond the window.
Maybe he was talking to himself. Maybe _beautiful_ , as in _good job_ ,
as in _look what I just did with my own two hands_ _._
