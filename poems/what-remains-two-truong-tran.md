# what remains two
## Truong Tran
it has long been forgotten this practice of the mother
weaning a child she crushes the seeds of a green
chili rubs it to her nipple what the child feels
she too will   share in this act   of love
my own mother says it was not meant
to be cruel when cruelty she tells me
is a child’s lips   torn from breast as proof
back home the women wear teeth marks
