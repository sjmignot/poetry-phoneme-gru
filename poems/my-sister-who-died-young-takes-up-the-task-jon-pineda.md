# My Sister, Who Died Young, Takes Up The Task
## Jon Pineda
A basket of apples brown in our kitchen,
their warm scent is the scent of ripening,

and my sister, entering the room quietly,
takes a seat at the table, takes up the task

of peeling slowly away the blemished skins,
even half-rotten ones are salvaged carefully.

She makes sure to carve out the mealy flesh.
For this, I am grateful. I explain, _this elegy_

 _would love to save everything._ She smiles at me,
and before long, the empty bowl she uses fills,

domed with thin slices she brushes into
the mouth of a steaming pot on the stove.

 _What can I do?_ I ask finally. _Nothing,_
she says, _let me finish this one thing alone._
