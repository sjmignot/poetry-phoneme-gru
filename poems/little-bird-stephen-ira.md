# Little Bird
## Stephen Ira
I sang all night for you, but you didn’t care. You were too sad. _Little bird_
,  I said to myself, _you can’t bring anybody back, but maybe you can keep him
here_. I thought you liked my song. But I couldn’t tell now. You looked angry,
but you stayed in the room where I sang. I inherited the song. Not from my
parents. Not from my grandmother. My grandfather doesn’t sing. My song was
mine and I thought you liked it. I thought you loved me. Now you showed no
sign of loving anything. But you stayed in the room all night. The room was
full of statues with coins under their tongues. I felt bad for building them.
Some don’t even have names. Sylvia, Ian, Anne, Emily, Seb. You barely moved.
Sometimes, you moved. _Little bird_ , I told myself, _little bird_ ,
pretending I was you, _I love you. Please sing for me_. I didn’t want you to
leave.  I kept singing.
