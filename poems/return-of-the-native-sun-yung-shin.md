# Return of the Native
## Sun Yung Shin
Because of time being an arrow, I had to imagine everything.

I had to fold the song with my mind because of the time being. Wash the rice
here, in the present.

Because of the arrow I pent up the fourth wall as though I were diapering my
own newborn.

I put time to the breast, though I feared it was not an arrow but an asp.

Being time I kept that fear under my tongue like a thermometer. I felt its
mercury rolling under my teeth, boiling like language.

A deaf man, an old man, I am his hand, rough and gentle, an arrow here and
then.

Time, I can see what I feel.

In the future even your future becomes my past. Arrow, I have died. There is
peace. I pull it from me like a blanket.

As in a dream, because of time being an arrow, I put on the dress of a young,
lovely mother. Because of her, because of the time, here I am, always watching
over you.
