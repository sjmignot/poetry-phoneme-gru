# And Also with You

The comet taught us how to watch the war.
The comet contended that fire

is romantic and recommended we each behold it alone,
envisioning out there somewhere our next
lover, craning up at this same sky.

Was the comet simply endeavoring
to keep us divided, I asked it, and the comet

did not reply. Then we discovered the men
who wanted us dead
were convening at night on the site where their hero

had been unceremoniously
interred. And so we exhumed the guy, burned him up,
and fed his ash to the rapids,

to be churned into marlstone and mud-rich
air. Good thinking. Now heâ€™s everywhere.
