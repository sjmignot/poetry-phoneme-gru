_After Roselia Foundling Asylum and Maternity Hospital,  corner of Cliff and
Manilla_

This is the house I was born in.
Look at it. Asylum.

Narrate it:
Notice the sloping cornice, look at the curved windows, etc.

This is the house I was born in.
The cast-iron balconies / not wide enough for bodies.

Look at the photos:
3 stories, 8 front windows and a wide door.

Dark red brick / inlaid with brown stone.
Women’s bodies / expelling  / banishing  /

Leaving the babies there.
Look at the photos, include the photos.
