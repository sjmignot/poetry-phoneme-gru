# Sex tape or Future and Audre Lorde fall in love
## Harmony Holiday
Despite all their fervor     they were headed somewhere   limp   in the
intellect     nursery rhyme dialect headed   somewhere   all   circumference
hunnid   something for Sumerian   tablet happy meals   where you get     to
munch   the   code-cold   sun upfront     the rest   when you’ve     eaten a
bit of rat flesh   in the shape of yesterday     perishing

                              youth addiction : Future dreams of codeine
nibbles the white nipple wedged between him and his     soul   stice staaay
sis what is this?     passes out     on the battlefield, improviser  /
wisest man I ever   mumbled   alongside     Power   with all the wars   in it
ain’t shit     in   a   flawed   system     besides   self-destruction   may
all our enemies   become powerful   and empty   in the west   while we sell
our bodies   these   mumbled   prayers codeine   ain’t got nothin to   do
with my   love, child   either

labor in the holds was painless
bled ’til the chains lost their grip
and there are   tapes   to prove it
