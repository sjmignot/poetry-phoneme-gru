# All the Dead Boys Look Like Me
## Christopher Soto
Last time I saw myself die is when police killed Jessie Hernandez

                                      A 17 year old brown queer // who was
sleeping in their car

Yesterday I saw myself die again // Fifty times I died in Orlando // &

                        I remember reading // Dr. José Esteban Muñoz before he
passed

I was studying at NYU // where he was teaching // where he wrote shit

                        That made me feel like a queer brown survival was
possible // But he didn’t

Survive & now // on the dancefloor // in the restroom // on the news // in my
chest

                        There are another fifty bodies that look like mine //
& are

Dead // & I’ve been marching for Black Lives & talking about police brutality

                        Against Native communities too // for years now // but
this morning

I feel it // I really feel it again // How can we imagine ourselves // We
being black native

                        Today // Brown people // How can we imagine ourselves

When All the Dead Boys Look Like Us? // Once I asked my nephew where he wanted

                        To go to College // What career he would like // as if

The whole world was his for the choosing // Once he answered me without
fearing

                        Tombstones or cages or the hands from a father // The
hands of my lover

Yesterday praised my whole body // Made angels from my lips // Ave Maria

                        Full of Grace // He propped me up like the roof of a
cathedral // in NYC

Before we opened the news & read // & read about people who think two brown
queers

                        Can’t build cathedrals // only cemeteries // & each
time we kiss

A funeral plot opens // In the bedroom I accept his kiss // & I lose my
reflection

                        I’m tired of writing this poem // but I want to say
one last word about

Yesterday // my father called // I heard him cry for only the second time in
my life

                        He sounded like he loved me // it’s something I’m
rarely able to hear

& I hope // if anything // his sound is what my body remembers first.
