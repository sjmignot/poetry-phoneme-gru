# A Walk in the River
## Ren√© Magritte
A few companions had been doing too much talking beside the purple water. The
troupe, panic-stricken, ran away, and I found I was incapable of following
them. I stepped into the water and the depths turned luminous; faraway ferns
could just be seen. The reflections of other dark plants stopped them rising
to the surface. Red threads took on all sorts of shapes, caught in the
invisible and doubtless powerful currents. A plaster-cast woman advancing
caused me to make a gesture which was to take me far.
