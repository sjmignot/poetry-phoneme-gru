An extremely hubristic, unflattering, and accurate self-portrait, this episode
saw Halberg in direct conversa-
tion with Cain, questioning his own methods. The passing allusion to Pushkin’s
_Eugene Onegin_ appears
to reference Chapter 4, stanza XXXV: “But I myself read my bedizened /fancies,
my rhythmic search for truth, /to nobody except a wizened /nanny, companion of
my youth; /or, after some dull dinner’s labour, /
I buttonhole a wandering neighbour /and in a corner make him choke /on
tragedy; but it’s no joke, /when,

space, the analogue of a quadrant (2D) or an octant (3D). **Thumb-horned** has
the feel of an order of mockery /cuckoldry but may also be a reference to
Cain’s mark, according to some scholars, being the gradual protrusion of
horns. A **T-totum** (or teetotum) is a little metal Roman spinning top used
for gambling. William Ernest Henley’s “The Double Ballade on the Nothingness
of Things” opens with the lines: “The big teetotum twirls, /And epochs wax and
wane /As chance subsides or swirls ... ” Triskaidekaphobia can be traced back
to the Zoroastrianism of ancient Persia where the 13th day of each new year is
considered evil, or a day when the power of evil is particularly intense and
can cause trouble, thus to this day people leave cities and camp overnight in
the countryside. God has **thirteen** attributes of mercy according to
rabbinic commentary on the Torah, and thirteen is also the number of nodes
which make up Metatron’s Cube in Kabbalistic account. Metatron is an
extraordinarily important angel in the apocryphal _Book of the Palaces_ ; it
is suggested that Metatron is the only reason the human race was given
knowledge of God and the cube forms a kind of “map of creation.” This appears
to relate back to the “rhombohedral monolith” of the early episodes, the
college’s strange obelisks. It is worth mentioning that Euclidean spaces
generalize to higher dimensions. I feel really weird.
