"I grant you ample leave **grant you ample leave** In other words, to let you
express your grand opinion
To use the hoary **hoary** Ancient, worthy of respect for its age formula 'I
am'
Naming the emptiness where thought is not;
But fill the void with definition, 'I'
Will be no more a datum **datum** A single piece of data or information than
the words
You link false inference **false inference** In philosophy and logic, an
inference is the act or process of deriving logical conclusions from premises
known or assumed to be true. Inferences are typically evaluated to be valid or
invalid. with, the 'Since' & 'so'
That, true or not, make up the atom-whirl **atom-whirl** The orbital paths of
electrons around the nucleus.
Resolve your 'Ego' **‘Ego’** Latin for “I”., it is all one web
With vibrant ether clotted into worlds:
Your subject, self, or self-assertive 'I'
Turns nought but object, melts to molecules,
Is stripped from naked Being with the rest
Of those rag-garments named the Universe.
Or if, in strife to keep your 'Ego' strong
You make it weaver of the etherial light **etherial light** Heavenly light,
Space, motion, solids & the dream of Time —
Why, still 'tis Being looking from the dark,
The core, the centre of your consciousness,
That notes your bubble-world **bubble-world** : sense, pleasure, pain,
What are they but a shifting otherness,
Phantasmal flux **Phantasmal flux** A fantastic, ghostlike stream or flow of
moments? —"
