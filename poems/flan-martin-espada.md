# Flan
## Martín Espada
For  Jack Agueros (1934-2014)
I was eight when the blackout struck and the lights died all across the city
like a massacre of fireflies. In the projects of Brooklyn, I steered myself
to 14F, fingers spread against the cool tiles of the hallway, past the
concrete
and chicken-wire terrace where I once burnt ants with a magnifying glass.

Many years later, at the Chinese restaurant uptown, Jack said: _They got_
 _any flan here?_ He was my first poet. I had seen the fireflies in his
sonnets
blink and float away: Fulano the philosopher in the unemployment line;
Blanco the painter, painting in the madhouse; Monterosa the dealer killed
by shotgun in a bar on Avenue A; his mother the seamstress and the quick
needle of her sewing machine; Jack the moving man, his hands sliced raw.
He stacked his apartment with dictionaries in three languages. I knew
the raconteur’s grin with every tale: _Raúl Juliá is a friend of mine:_
 _a Puerto Rican playing Macbeth. He took_ _14_ _curtain calls on opening
night._

Maybe he would tell me now that flan was not Puerto Rican, or Mexican,
or Spanish, but Chinese, invented by a trembling cook to satisfy the palate
of an emperor in the Ming Dynasty. _No flan, Jack_ , I said. _This is a
Chinese_
 _restaurant_. Two minutes later, he said: _They got any flan?_ I showed him
the dog-eared and fingerprinted menu. _No flan_ , I said. When the waiter
unfurled his pad, Jack said to him: _You got flan?_ He sang this song for an
hour.
The egg roll was not flan. The fried rice was not flan. The fortune cookie
was not flan. _Can we get some flan?_ he said. _Goddammit, Jack_ , I said.

The poets crowded into the bar, striding to the mic. Jack stood with poem
in hand, read the title, tilted his head and said it again, studied the page
as if the words shriveled up like ants burnt under a magnifying glass,
then sat down. I witnessed the massacre of fireflies. A few of us clapped,
not knowing what to do with our hands, staring at the sonneteer who lost
all his quatrains and couplets in the denim jacket he left on the subway,
the words of Fulano still waiting on the unemployment line: _The faster_
 _you spin, the stiller you look._ /  _There’s something to learn in that, but
what?_

After the diagnosis, I handed Jack a book of poems. He dangled the book
upside down like a stiff mouse by the tail, something we would sniff  behind
the refrigerator. I wanted sonnets. Jack kept singing the chorus of a song:
 _Get me to the church. Get me to the church. Get me to the church on time._

At the end, I leaned over Jack’s bed to read his own poem in his ear, but some
words come home after the blackout, fingers crawling on the wall. I know
what I should have said at the Chinese restaurant: _Jack, let’s get some
flan_.
We should have braved the subway at rush hour, straphangers rocking
all the way to 14th Street and 8th Avenue, to La Taza de Oro, gone now
like Jack, for rice and beans, squid in its own ink, café con leche y flan,
Jack: a spoonful of flan for you after all the years of sonnets and bread
for me, the steam rising when your hands cracked the crust at the table.
