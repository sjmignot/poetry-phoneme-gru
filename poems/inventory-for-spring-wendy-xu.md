# Inventory for Spring
## Wendy Xu
Feeling rich for one moment for using money as a bookmark
Feeling deceitful for making public some opinions while neglecting others
Feeling disordered at the sight of three statues conspiring in a row
Feeling insufficient for having a lukewarm reaction to news
Feeling important for having been offered a seat at the table
Feeling apologetic for nonetheless tuning out an argument
Feeling blue for identifying some people who don’t respect you
Feeling like a knife slipping into a pool of water for bearing  disagreement
Feeling redundant for moving in a similar direction as others
Feeling angry for imagining the opening of the passage yet  unopened for you
Feeling antisocial for declining further missives from home
