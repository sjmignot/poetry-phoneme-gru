# I Make Promises Before I Dream
## Tongo Eisen-Martin
No unclaimed, cremated mothers this year

Nor collateral white skin

No mothers folding clothes to a corporate park preamble
No sons singing under the bright lights of a lumber yard

Quantum reaganomics and the tap steps of turning on a friend

New York trophy parts among
            the limbs of decent people

                       Being an enraged artist is like
                       entering a room and not knowing what to get high off of

                                                      My formative symbols/My
upbringing flying to an agent’s ears
I might as well be an activist

Called my girlfriend and described
                                                                All the
bottles segregationists had thrown at me that day

                                                                   Described
recent blues sites and soothing prosecutions
I feared for my poetry

You have to make art every once in a while
            While in the company of sell-outs
            Accountant books in deified bulk
            Or while waiting for a girl under a modern chandelier

                                                           Or in your last
lobby as a wanderer

The prison foot-races the museum

My instrument ends

                        I mean, what is a calendar to the slave?
                                               Also, what is a crystal prism?

“He bought this bullet,
bought its flight,
then bought two more”
