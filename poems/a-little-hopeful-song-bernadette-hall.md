# a little hopeful song
## Bernadette Hall
For Sile
I give thee the sun as guarantee
and the Egyptian faience beads

and the little silver oar that was gifted once
to an English harbor master.

I give thee the silk dress
with its triple-ruffled sleeves and

the cloaks with big hoods that fall full
though some are pulled in at a central button.

I give thee the little colored goats
that go down on their knees as penitents.

I give thee the death mask
and the plaster hand of Seán Ó Riada,

for he is among the best loved of the musicians.
