# Perspective
## Amy King
When I see the two cops laughing
after one of them gets shot
because this is TV and one says
while putting pressure on the wound,
 _Haha, you're going to be fine,_
and the other says,  _I know, haha!_ ,
as the ambulance arrives—
I know the men are white.
I think of a clip from the hours
of amateur footage I've seen
when another man at an intersection
gets shot, falls, and bleeds from a hole
the viewer knows exists only by the way
the dark red pools by the standing cop's feet,
gun now holstered, who
yells the audience back to the sidewalk.
I know which one is dying
while black and which one stands by white.
I think this morning about the student
in my class who wrote a free write line
on the video I played
that showed a man pouring water
on his own chest, "...the homoerotic
scene against a white sky" with no other men
present.  _Who gets to see and who follows_
 _what scrip_ t? I ask my students.
Whose lines are these and by what hand
are they written?
