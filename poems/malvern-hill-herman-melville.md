# Malvern Hill
## Herman Melville
(July, 1862)
Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill
     In prime of morn and May,
Recall ye how McClellan’s men
     Here stood at bay?
While deep within yon forest dim
     Our rigid comrades lay—
Some with the cartridge in their mouth,
Others with fixed arms lifted South—
            Invoking so
The cypress glades? Ah wilds of woe!

The spires of Richmond, late beheld
     Through rifts in musket-haze,
Were closed from view in clouds of dust
     On leaf-walled ways,
Where streamed our wagons in caravan;
     And the Seven Nights and Days
Of march and fast, retreat and fight,
Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plight—
            Does the elm wood
Recall the haggard beards of blood?

The battle-smoked flag, with stars eclipsed
     We followed (it never fell!)—
In silence husbanded our strength—
          Received their yell;
Till on this slope we patient turned
     With cannon ordered well;
Reverse we proved was not defeat;
But ah, the sod what thousands meet!—
               Does Malvern Wood
Bethink itself, and muse and brood?

                        _We elms of Malvern Hill_
 _Remember every thing;_
 _But sap the twig will fill;_
 _Wag the world how it will,_
 _Leaves must be green in Spring._
