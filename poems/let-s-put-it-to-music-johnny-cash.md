# Let's Put It To Music
## Johnny Cash
How do you feel about me
Now that you've learned to know me?
Why don't we both admit
That something is happening.
And we would feel better if
We'd just tell each other
No need to keep it to ourselves.
Let's put it to music
Let's put it to music
Let's sing about it
Laugh about it
Clap our hands
And shout about it
Let the whole world hear it
In a sweet, sweet melody
Let's put it to music, you and me.
