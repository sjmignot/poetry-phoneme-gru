Waves smack the body,
Nayeli, seven, drowning.
Spring: crossing season.



ii

Summer indicates
the migration will be “safe.”
Yej Susen, three, sprints.



iii

Inda Jani, one,
knows to crawl under the fence —
she was trained all fall.



iv

At four ai-em, Yao,
twelve, is sewn inside car seat;
winter will protect.



v

Itzel, five, plays dead.
Border patrol agents see
her body — they leave.
