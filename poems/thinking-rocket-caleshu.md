# Thinking
## Rocket Caleshu
I am thinking that
to make thinking new again
is torch-lit work, subterranean

and exalted. Antarctica, Goethe,
Methuselah. Seven hills of Rome.
An advertisement for a summer farming gig

on a homestead in Alaska puzzles me:
imagine harvesting kale through days
of unrepentant 24-hour sunlight,

covered in mosquitoes. How do you do
the things in the dark when there is no dark?
I want now to tell you abt my love

for my whip, for killing the engine and sitting
in the garage. This is also an ancient
practice.
