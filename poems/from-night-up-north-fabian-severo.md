# From "Night Up North"
## Fabián Severo
My mother spoke perfectly well, and I understood.
 _Fabi andá faser los deber_ , and I’d do my chores.
 _Fabi traseme meio litro de leite_ , I brought her half a liter of milk.
 _Desí pra doña Cora que amañá le pago —_
I told Doña Cora she’d get paid tomorrow.
 _Deya iso gurí_  — stop that, child — and I would stop.

But my teacher didn’t understand.
She’d send home letters in my notebook
all in red, like her face, and signed at the bottom.

But my mother didn’t understand.
 _Le iso pra mim, ijo_ , and I’d read them to her.

But my mother didn’t understand.
 _Qué fiseste meu fío_  — what did you do, child —
 _te dise a que portaras bien_ , and I _did_ behave myself.

The story repeated itself for months.
My teacher wrote, but my mother didn’t understand.
My teacher wrote, but my mother didn’t understand.

Then one day my mother understood.
She said, _Meu fío, tu terás que deiyá la iscuela_  —
so I quit that school.
