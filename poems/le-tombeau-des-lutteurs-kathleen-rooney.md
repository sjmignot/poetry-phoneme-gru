# Le Tombeau des Lutteurs
## Kathleen Rooney
It is a tragedy, yes, but a confusing one. What happened to the wrestlers and
where have they gone? Loulou the Pomeranian would love to know. Outdoors the
hills are buried in snow, but inside a rose, a rose full-blown, a roomful of
rose. The bloom and its shadow overtaking the space. The bloom proposing an
impossible tomb. Of the Tachists, the master said to his friend Harry, “They
paint white on white, and they believe that this is an achievement.” Harry
said,  “I dare you to paint a white rose in a white room with a window looking
onto a landscape covered with snow.” Now this — which even Loulou, color-
blindish, can tell is red — is the master’s grandiose response to an
intoxicating challenge. Synesthetically, the rose fills Loulou’s pom ears with
the echoes of torch songs, longing for the wrong. Loulou is practically drunk
from the smell: a heady pink, and juicy, and almost obscene. Like crushed up
candies, lingering and sweet, but with an adult musk at the core: a powerful
flower. In looking, Loulou’s heart becomes a house at dusk about to force
something to happen.
