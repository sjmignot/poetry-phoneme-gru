# Calf's Tail
## Sangeeta Singh
Aji held onto the brown and black
patched calfâ€™s tail
A pundit sang her mantra for
43 minutes
Years
Aji understood the calf would
lead her through oceans
into her next journey
My Aji and I
are alike
We have silver hairs
I am holding on to a dream tail
hoping it will carry me
through oceans
into my next journey
