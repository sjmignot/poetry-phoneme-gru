# Speaking of the South: 1961
## Joe Bolton
### 1990

John F. Kennedy is alive and loved, and the moon remains 
Somewhat of a mystery, and suburbs and shopping malls

Are mainly somebody’s bad ideas, and you can still
Speak of the South in a voice not wholly laden with loss.

In Cadiz, Kentucky, my father pastors a Baptist church;
My mother types up his sermons, visits the town’s sick.

Later, he’ll leave the ministry to sell stocks and bonds,
And she’ll leave him for a journalist from Birmingham

Kennedy will be shot. People will yawn at the conquered moon.
The South will sprout suburbs and shopping malls like tubercles.

But for now, say it’s December in Cadiz, Kentucky.
Tinsel for Christmas drapes Main Street, flickering

As duck comes on cold with a blue wind of Lake Barkley
The poolroom and diner fill with smoke and the low voices

Of men who carry inside them the stillness of the filed
They hope work for at least another twenty-five years.

A boy kisses his girl goodbye and follows his visible breath
Home, dreaming of her creamy thighs and red Chevrolet.

In the Wishy-Washy, the divorcee folds her stained whites.
And in a yellow room of the Trigg County Hospital,

I am born—not yet named, nor equipped with the facility
Of language, but squalling even then to make myself heard.
