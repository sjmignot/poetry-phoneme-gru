# Washing Palms
## Douglas Manuel
When the junkies my father sold crack to got
too close to me, he told them to back up

six dicks’ lengths. This is the man who when I was
seven caught me under the bed crying and said:

 _Save those tears. You’ll need them later._
The man who told me he smoked crack

because he liked it, the man sitting on his couch
now watching the History Channel, scratching

the nub beneath his knee where his leg used to be,
gumming plums, his false teeth

soaking in vinegar on the table. I’m sitting
across the room trying to conjure each version

he’s shown of himself, trying to lie
in water warm enough

to soak away the switch he hit me with.
To help me summon love for the man

who just asked me if he can borrow 200 dollars,
the man who once told me: _Wish_

 _in one hand, then shit in the other,_
 _and see which one fills up the quickest._
