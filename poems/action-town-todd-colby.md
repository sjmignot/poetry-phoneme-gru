# Action Town
## Todd Colby
Right now I'm sipping a mango lassi
in Action Town. I'm not bereft at all. In fact,
I'm pleasantly aware of people moving on all fours.
Our voice and text messages will
be erased in no time. When I walk into stores
they call me Spark Plug because I have a sparky manner.
Things get all wavy from their constant attention.
It's going to be okay. I'm a good habit:
you don't need to trick me.
I'm not sure where I should put my hands
when I walk down the street with you.
It's funny to think about who I would
call if something really awful happened.
I'd be jumping up and down not knowing who to call.
My way of doing things is scary even to me.
Remember the toothbrush, the honey bear,
and the meal that we thought would never end?
I'm counting on you to come through high water,
to come through chaos, and to Action Town,
where we'll lift our aces to skyward aviation.
