## Alfred Starr Hamilton
On the back of an invoice
I wrote my name in large Capitalist June Blue Letters

And because money was involved
And so was my name ever in jeopardy

On the back of the same invoice
I rewrote my name in large Capitalist June Blue Letters

And in Leopardy and in Jeopardy
I resolved, dissolved upon a radical eradicator

Inking in, dissolving upon
Jeopardizing in my own name in large Capitalist June Blue Letters
