# Thanksgiving Day ["Over the river and through the wood"]
## Lydia Maria Child
Over the river and through the wood,
    To grandfather's house we go;
         The horse knows the way
         To carry the sleigh
    Through the white and drifted snow.

Over the river and through the wood--
    Oh, how the wind does blow!
         It stings the toes
         And bites the nose,
    As over the ground we go.

Over the river and through the wood,
    To have first-rate play.
         Hear the bells ring,
         "Ting-a-ling-ding!"
    Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!

Over the river and through the wood,
    And straight through the barn-yard gate.
         We seem to go
         Extremely slow--
    It is so hard to wait!

Over the river and through the wood--
    Now grandmother's cap I spy!
         Hurrah for the fun!
         Is the pudding done?
    Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie!
