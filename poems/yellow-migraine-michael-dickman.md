# Yellow Migraine
## Michael Dickman
Daffodils shimmy
in the dilated onion grass
their hearts out

Shelovesme Shelovesmenot

Smeared
against the sidewalk

Urine left in the toilet all day simmers under halogens

Listening
to someone else breathe
listening to static cling

Time to wipe down the refrigerator with a handful of ibuprofen and a bandanna
         soaked in tonic water

Butter-butter
Black lemons
Pine-Sol

Daffodils shimmy
in the dilated onion grass
their asses off

Other yellow flowers I don’t see you yet

Noon
tears down the street
a terrible kid
on a brand-new

Now I remember the faces of tulips

Speechless

Yellow peaches
sweat inside brown
paper bags

Press your forehead against the pit in the perfect peach and everything will
stop
         moving how about that?

Daffodils shimmy
in the dilated onion grass
their eyes closed

Close your eyes I close my eyes

Families of worms work their yellow way up through clouds in the mustard air

Slams into the yard

Pollen
lies down on everything
it just lies down
sun the color of
photosynthesis and
that’s fine

Birds bark inside houses

Yellow fingers work the yellow spine
