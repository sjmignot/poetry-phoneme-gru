# Shrill Shirts Will Always Balloon
## Jennifer Robertson
he walks like a monologue
pauses like the word _saudade_

he rarely makes a turn
yet becomes an acute angle

landscapes and shadows
return

to a partially foaming home
corners start talking

a girl waves back
prodigally

becomes available to touch
now, even if a knee

doesn’t blur, doesn’t bend
the world will still turn bokeh

otters will remain otters
doors will remain doors

the keys won’t fit
