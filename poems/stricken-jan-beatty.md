# Stricken
## Jan Beatty
We’re sitting in Uncle Sam’s Subs, splitting
a cheesesteak, when Shelley says:
 _I think I should buy a gun._
I look up at her puffy face, and she’s staring,
her hands shaking. On medication for
schizophrenia, she’s serious.
I say, _Tell me why you need a gun._
Her voice getting louder: _You know why._
 _No, no I don’t_ , I say.
 _In case I need it. I might need it to shoot somebody._
I give her a hard look —  _You don’t need a gun.
_
No one is after you.
She stares back: _You might be after me_.
I don’t know what to say — I never know what to say.
I know it’s not her speaking, but it’s my friend,
far away in some other stricken mind.
What’s it like to know you’re right/
you’re in danger —
and the world says no?
Every woman I know has lived that.
I say: _I would never hurt you. I’m not a threat to you_.
She laughs, says, _Well, you might be_.
The laughing scares me.
I want out of this place,
this sub shop, to walk away,
knowing she can’t walk out of her mind, leave
the illness behind. The long minutes,
the long, long minutes. She says, _What do you think?
_
I think we should eat our sandwiches, then
take a walk, I say.
 _What about the gun?_
 _Let’s talk about it later_ , I say,
not knowing a thing.
Not knowing a goddamn thing.
