new oddcouple friendship
raised many eyebrows
 _one thing he doesn’t want_

               “I come in peace
and _basketball_
some hungover blue blue

a doe-eyed girl, I was
trying to tell you a simple story
did you want me back

on Celebrity Apprentice
yes yes yes yes
a real human being

who let his guard down
 _((he’s not his dad_
I’m sleeping in your bed

while you sleep smothered
in stars, a foreign city
not the _dirtbag_

you fight to shrug off inside
 _he says that
_
he don’t want war

doesn’t want to touch
this tattooed body
sheltered in a solar cave



what the cuban missile crisis was for the us   (3 /10

do my best across
two thousand miles
to “seem very close and          “very real

constantly having _shrugged off_
this new _sense of vulnerability_
like seeing Peggy at nineteen weeks

           ((womanly, growing growing

each day we don’t talk
I fail to matter,      the sky
breaches      some tense standstill

 _even small miscalculations_
die deep in the earth,
(whose womb           ((unburnt

what in the world between us
could start         again
that negative sun

 _could quickly inflame_

another way of saying
dew point          hoarfrost,
white tendrils cast

nuclear winter keeps trying
     to speak to me
 _didn’t answer two calls_

//
 _((quickly ((quickly pull together_

                                                 he’s something quite
remarkable
                                                 strong, conniving, poised to
appear
 _on a global stage_










           “‘virtual nonentity,’ a mere               region —


                       “whose ‘natural’ function was to serve







 _am I capable_

touching his eyelid, chin, upper lip
where the tooth went through
and there



 _of riding a hysterical horse into the sea_


                                                       did you feel safe?
cared after?
                                                       I was in the villages
then.
                                                       it’s hard for me to
say.



 _(uncertain, unsteady, unsure —_





                                in just one year    _to float_
                                my skin softened strange, did I
                                know where I was   who

to make a horizon, if
only to see you again

                                                 to have crossed new and
dangerous lines




my side aches, how it all speaks to me
vague clouds inside   a name
can my attention deliver it

what harm in reaching out   from
a network   branching underground
more tremors, a biting pain


 _another day_





to “encircle” and contain   (3 /18




five days, _no sky appears_
  unease

latest successful test of
unspoken boundaries
furthers silence,

            disfigures my attention
toward fabric softener,
artificial sweeteners,      black
mold sweeping the hallways
                                                     where
I have to stand seven hours a day


I want to _be known to you_
