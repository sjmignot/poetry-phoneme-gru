# The Ships of Theseus
## Steve Gehrke
The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and
was preserved by the Athenians    ...    for they took away the old planks as
they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that
this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical
question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the
same, and the other contending that it was not the same.
-- Plutarch, Vita Thesel
The answer of course is that the ship
doesn’t exist, that “ship”
is an abstraction, a conception,
an imaginary tarp thrown
across the garden of the real.
The answer is that the cheap
peasantry of things toils all day
in the kingdom of  language,
every ship like a casket
of words: _bulkhead, transom,
_
mast steps. The answer
is to wake again to the banality
of things, to wade toward
the light inside the plasma
of ideas. But each plank
is woven from your mother’s
hair. The blade of each oar
contains the shadow of
a horse. The answer
is that the self is the glue between
the boards, the cartilage
that holds a world together,
that self is the wax in
the stenographer’s ears,
that there is nothing the mind
won’t sacrifice, each _item_
another goat tossed into
the lava of our needs.
The answer is that this is just
another poem about divorce,
about untombing the mattress
from the sofa, your body
laid out on the bones of the
double-jointed frame, about
separation, rebuilding, about
your daughter’s missing
teeth. Each time you visit
now you find her partially
replaced, more sturdily
jointed, the weathered joists
of   her childhood being stripped
away. New voice. New hair.
The answer is to stand there
redrawing the constellation
of   the word _daughter_ in
your brain while she tries
to understand exactly who
you are, and breathes out
girl after girl into the entry-
way, a fog of   strangers that
almost evaporates when
you say each other’s
names. Almost, but not quite.
Let it be enough. Already,
a third ship moves
quietly toward you in the night.
