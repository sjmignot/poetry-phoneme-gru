# the smell
## Emelihter Kihleng
_ke pwoahn Pohnpei_
I told him as we kissed
 _is that a good thing?_
he asked
 _hell yea_
I wanted to say
replaced it with another kiss
inhaling the mix of last night’s sakau en Pohnpei
seir en wai, sweat
rain
intoxicating
taking me home

he left that smell behind
it would barely linger by the time
he reached his destination
I was headed for it
so the smell stayed
bittersweet and blue
on my skin, in my hair
I carried it with me there
where it grew
mixed with mangoes,
coughs, handshakes, pigs,
babies, and old people

I’m back
it now reeks
won’t wash away
with the other smells
get in my car
it hits me
pungent remnants of the mwaramwar
he left behind.
