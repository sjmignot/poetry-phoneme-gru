# I walked through the trees, mourning.
## Cathy Linh Che
I looked brightness in the eye.
The iron, the tang of metal & rust.

I held a penny
on my tongue.

The taste shocked me,
its brown-gold sweet.

I roamed the field
angry & burned

asking bitter questions of a gun.

Dance is a body’s refusal
to die. But, oh, your gone hair.

The flame & orange flare.
Our forms, our least known selves —

barrel, sugar, & stench.
Your pleas, looped in writing,

the stutter of a body’s
broken grammar.
