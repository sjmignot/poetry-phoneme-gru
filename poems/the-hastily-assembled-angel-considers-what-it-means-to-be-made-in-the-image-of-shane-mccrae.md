# The Hastily Assembled Angel Considers What It Means to Be Made in the Image Of
## Shane McCrae
Humans being made      in the image not of God

Directly but of the angel      who the day God made

Human beings most resembled God      who changes

The way light changes as the sun in the morning



Becomes the sun in the afternoon      in the evening

And in the night      and to resemble God

Is to resemble light      the way a bed

Resembles sunlight      when sunlight is spread



Across it      to resemble God is to

Remain the bed as the light slides away

The hastily assembled angel when

Humans appeared on Earth      at first the an-



gel didn’t see      any resemblance he

Saw his reflection in a pond and marked

Neither the similarities nor differ-

ences between himself and humans      their



Voices climbed a canyon to his tent

In the clouds and though they laughed and shouted

With voices like the voices of the other

Angels he never once      hoped he was be-



ing called      _If God had made me for them_ he

Shouted down hours      after the laughing pack

Had left the canyon      _I might watch them_

Instead      God merely hadn’t called him back



After the other angels shoved him from

Heaven      instead the angel watched the sun until he

Began to think it was the eye of God

Even though he felt      sure God had



No eyes      no body      and no voice      with which

To call him back      instead he watched a forest

At the edge of the canyon he      watched it until

A different pack of humans cut the shortest



Fully grown tree down then he watched the tree as

The humans dragged it to their camp he watched the

Tree as the humans broke the tree apart he

Watched as the humans carved the parts of the tree in-



to gods with bodies and      glowering faces

He watched the humans as they bowed to the gods

He watched them      like a small child watching dancers

Forgetting his own body      bowing as they bow
