# Petard
## Rae Armantrout

We hoped to see things as they are
by which we meant without us.

We thought once we stripped away
smell, taste, color —

anything improper —

leaving only location
and number,

the thing
would be naked

on the teeter-totter
of an equation.

Then Archimedes
told another one.

If I had a long enough lever
and a fulcrum,

I’d get a high
resolution image

of objectified bodies
and hoist myself

on my own petard.
