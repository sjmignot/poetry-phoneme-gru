## Hannah Lowe
I carry you, a fleck, to Jamaica **At the Chinese temple in Kingston**
I am sick daily **Victor leads me upstairs, says this floor was once**
Nights, I hold the bed’s edges **full of beds where men off the boat
**
a raft on the rolling sea **slept, ate, washed sea salt from their skin,**
You inside me, all this hope **prayed at the jade altar with two lions**
Sweet speck, what will you be? **that too, had shipped from China.
**
Too new to be anything **We drive to the old cemetery, not before**
I say nothing **Victor pays the wild-eyed boy who “guards” the car.**
the way I stay silent **He might hurt us, the vodka bottle he holds is**
about my grandfather **made of blue glass. His lips are red and sore.**
who beat all his children **I stand on my grandfather’s small grave,**
with a strap **pen in hand. I am allowed to write his name on since
**
The sun burns the cemetery floor **the marker has been chipped off,
**
I am woozy **marble sold. Wow crazy day huh, Victor says. An honor**
I don’t know why I’m here **to pay your filial duty to your grandfather?**
