The coals you walked on
in places considered un-
civil gleam beneath
feet transformed they
gleam, new blades sharp you
are adept at conjuring shoes
for your bare feet & blood
pools easy along the obsidian
edge   you walk fast because of in
spite of    you are said to be laughing
until you cry you cry laughing
and wait for the water to reach
the earth soothe this fire you
are still learning the power
of the rheostat installed when you landed
without papers
once you had some    one    who
who kissedyoursoles    once    you
had   some    one who held your soles to
the fire in their foreheads, asking to be
blessed you once were that kind
of girl    war
bought a berth upon a lazaretto skimming
the surface of the sky
safety you learned
comes from concealing everything from
turning your own body to bread, your own
laughter into balm, in disguising your soul
red  bruises  purple  turn  calloused  you
watch them come, keeled over with want
ectothermic creatures, now hot now cold to help ease
your hot you’re cold and you watch like a witch
cursed and cursing, you don’t feel
the sliced beets carrying you now you
note how easily the knives perfect these useless things
you cut off at your knees to live
