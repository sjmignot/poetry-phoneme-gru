## Solmaz Sharif
Dear Aleph,

Like Ovid: _I’ll have no last words_.
This is what it means to die among barbarians. _Bar bar bar_
was how the Greeks heard our speech —
sheep, beasts — and so we became
 _barbarians_. We make them reveal
the brutes they are, Aleph, by the things
we make them name. David,
they tell me, is the one
one should aspire to, but ever since
I first heard them say _Philistine_
I’ve known I am Goliath
if I am anything.
