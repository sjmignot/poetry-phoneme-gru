## Garrett Caples
for Bill Berkson & Khaled al-Assad
the union president’s dead
& they won’t let transgender

people pee in north carolina
& here i’m complaining about

climbing the mountain again
the mountain’ll always remain

if i’m lucky, to keep me from
sucking & only a king mule will

do. humbled by bill as he goes
through the business of staying

alive with dignified unconcern. i
don’t deserve him, have no zen

no dasein, just half-a-dozen self
-inflicted wounds i’m expected

to grin & bear & like robert
plant, i do. it’s like i’m in

a rembrandt or something
holding testtubes to the sun

to read my urine specimens &
—spoiler alert—i’m trigger sad

checked my email mid-poem
so of course its bad news

the ancient city is practically
gone, palmyra, palmyra

at least i still have bill
here in isis usa
