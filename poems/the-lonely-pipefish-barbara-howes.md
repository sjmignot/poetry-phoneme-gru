# The Lonely Pipefish
## Barbara Howes
Up, up, slender
         As an eel’s
         Child, weaving
Through water, our lonely
Pipefish seeks out his dinner,

         Scanty at best; he blinks
         Cut-diamond eyes— _snap_ —he
         Grabs morsels so small
Only a lens pinpoints them,
But he ranges all over

         That plastic preserve—dorsal
         Fin tremulous— _snap_ —and
         Another çedilla
Of brine shrimp’s gone ...
We talk on of poetry, of love,

         Of grammar; he looks
         At a living comma—
 _Snap_ —sizzling about
In his two-gallon Caribbean
And grazes on umlauts for breakfast.

         His pug nosed, yellow
         Mate, aproned in gloom,
         Fed rarely, slumped,
Went deadwhite, as we argued on;
That rudder fin, round as a

         Pizza cutter, at the
         End of his two inch
         Fluent stick self, lets his eyes
Pilot his mouth— _snap_ ...
Does his kind remember? Can our kind forget?
