# A Dead Thing That, in Dying, Feeds the Living
## Donika Kelly
I’ve been thinking about the anatomy
of the egg, about the two interior membranes,

the yolk held in place by the chalazae, gases
moving through the semipermeable shell.

A curious phrase, _the anatomy of the egg,_
as if an egg were a body, which it is,

as if the egg could be broken then mended,
which, depending on your faith, broken yes,

but mended? Well. Best to start
again, with a new body, voided

from a warmer one, brooded and turned.
Better to begin as if some small-handed

animal hadn’t knocked you against a rock,
licked clean the rich yolk and left

the albumen to dry in the sun — as if a hinged
jaw hadn’t swallowed you whole.

What I wanted: a practice that reassured
that what was cracked could be mended

or, at least, suspended so that it could not spread.
But now I wonder: better to be the egg or scaled

mandible? The small hand or the flies, bottle black
and green, spilling their bile onto whatever’s left,

sweeping the interior, drinking it clean?
I think, _something might have grown there_ , though

I know it was always meant to be eaten,
it was always meant to spoil.
