# Yellow Dress
## Amy Beeder
Port-au-Prince
Girl on a heap of street sweepings high
as a pyre, laid on snarled wire & dented rim.
Girl set down among the wrung-out hides.
A girl who was coming from church. It is late
Sunday afternoon. _Was it a seizure? Is it_
 _destiny or bad luck we should fear? Weak heart_
 _or swerving taxi?_ In Tet Bef by the dirty ocean
thousands crush past her without pausing
at the shrine of her spayed limbs; brilliance
like the flesh of lilies sprouting from the pummeled cane.
 _Is it possible to be lighthearted, hours later?_
 _Days? To forget the yellow dress?_
I am waiting for her mother to find her, still
wearing one white spotless glove _(where is the other?),_
my idle taxi level with her unbruised arm,
her fingers just curling like petals of a fallen flower
 _and how did it end_? Let someone have gathered her up
before the stars assembled coldly overhead:
her dress brighter than gold, crocus, the yolk of an egg
 _her face covered like the bride of a god_ ; let them
have found her & borne her though the traffic's clamor
veiled with a stranger's handkerchief.
