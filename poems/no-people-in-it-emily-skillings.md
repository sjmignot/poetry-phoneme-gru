# No People in It

I flutter in order
to enter
the phrase’s silver.

 _Jackdaws have launched nearby_
this time, silk green and ripped,
the movement a kind of chafing thinking.

Oh he’s marking
terrain right there—
right there with his

unmade song. The shadow kids
whip fronds, froth air up
into heat, pure and simple

“violence of the eye.” Wild iris
ink, wet in the margin’s stage.
Well, hadn’t this testament begun

to carry its chime in stripes?
That’s when I knew he was going away
from me, towards the sound.

Like the ring on the table
it can’t be decentered.
Rim around the recent.

Ashes, ashes,
A bright tangled seeming.
