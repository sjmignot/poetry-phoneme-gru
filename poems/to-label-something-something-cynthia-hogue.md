# ("to label something something")
## Cynthia Hogue
There was an ancient well-site beneath the labyrinth
I did not reach, the part underground,
labeled (what else?) The Crypt.

But labels always hide something
about what they seem to define.
They set the thing apart

without disclosing why.
Alive costs a pretty penny
to see The Crypt now.
