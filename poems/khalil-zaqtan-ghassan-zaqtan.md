# Khalil Zaqtan
## Ghassan Zaqtan
And I will bend down to smell his desire
his tomb's flowers and marble
his wilting joy
his swapping temptation for content

And I will keep him from the cold, visitors, oleander,
and the sons of bitches and say: No one
will resemble me like my father
his white stumbling and the illusion that plucks words

A shout that walks on two feeble legs
eyes me with the summer of discontent
and sprinkles me with water, turns me green
before it shakes the bitter dirt
off its fingers
… that's my father
he cried from a darkness in the grave

And I will gather the house of your chucked absence
as if we were alone on Earth
… you die
so I can fold the falcon's wings after its departure
and believe the silence that remains
