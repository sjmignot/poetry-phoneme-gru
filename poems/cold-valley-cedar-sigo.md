# Cold Valley
## Cedar Sigo
The fog
shades
a smooth
stone bust

then slips
into rain

my mind is
well suited
onyx
shining edges

the reflection
itself

*

Traces of
mist

on an old
window

*

The best part
is grinding
the ink down
endlessly, filling
my brush

grey morning

I first feel
the mind
as reflex

*
Bright and clear

The end of Evergreen road
is closed and crumbling away

Bill McNeil’s red poppy
resolves to be eaten alive
exposed to a shaft of air

between the flower and its flat glass-
masterful

*

The black bleeds out
from his beak

in long tears, ink onto
sopping head feathers
slicked back

black stiches on yellow
powdered eyes aglow

white speckles
          thrown onto autumn
                       breast feathers

a white field
                   below
