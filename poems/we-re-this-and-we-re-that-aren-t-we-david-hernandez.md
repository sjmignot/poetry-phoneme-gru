# We're This and We're That, Aren't We?
## David Hernandez
Now that the theoretical physicist slash cosmologist
has explained to me, has laid out in clean
even rows of logic

how every atom in my body
arrived from a star, a star
that blasted apart,
and the atoms of my left hand


originated from a different sun
than my right,

I can shine. I can go dark

recalling how my grandfather made
the vertical blinds rattle
when he shoved
my grandmother into them.


Startled in the yard, I turned to that sound,
from the flower bed my eyes were held by

the swaying blinds. It took a while for each
to line up

perfectly straight again, to tell myself

she slipped. Only then could I

return to stalking the butterflies.
My right hand was quick: reach and pinch.
I had so many soft wings that summer

between my thumb and index, so many of them
skewered on cactus needles.

I was a kid. I was cruel slash gentle.
He was cruel slash gentle.
He had witnessed my destroying
and I saw

across his creased face
empathy for them.

After his scolding I placed one dead one
inside the white envelope of a flower.

Under the sun it glowed. Under the moon,
more glowing.
