# Study for Belief with Lines from "Star Trek: The Original Series"

 Let every sentence begin: I have been grossly mistaken.
 _The stars are gone._ Kirk: _Kindly tell me what happened to the stars._
Kierkegaard shuttles past Reason to planet Absurd, a gas giant
without a detectable landing pad. He says, it’s the leap that matters.
 _We’re being pulled toward the center of the zone of darkness._
Kenosis required, emptying the self of self. His sky lit, mine blazes
black, an experimental physics. Doubt the gravity that repels, attracts.
Dark energy : Dark matter : Attempt to probe : Universe [Static].
Neil deGrasse Tyson: _we are a speck on a speck on a speck
_
on a speck. Spock: _Call it deep understanding._
I’m trying to compensate for loss _Red Alert. [High-pitched tone]_

pushing buttons, turning knobs, neon flash and whir,
wired to what? _Shields up._ Stage set or power source? I’m ionized negative,
charged with tiny circles bearing minus signs. _What was it you sensed?

Or is it better, translucent? Ladder rungs removed. Stairs—
 _What was it you sensed? Astonishment_ —phaser-blasted.
Jammed turbolifts. Sealed conduits. Is up a place (I want to be
