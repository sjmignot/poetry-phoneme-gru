# Agnus Dei
## Steven Toussaint
After Denise Levertov
Must be a stumbler, bleeder,
as some floccus remains here, carded
into ragged sleeves by barbed wire.
I’d believe in a God who can learn

to work new spindles, new pupils
uncomprehending the reasons
light rosins in winter, and still
spill clumsily, bleeding.
Now drizzle caught

in oily pockets loads the fleece
with wealth. I’ve often wondered
what the fence keeps out
in a country bereft of predators.
I long ago reconciled

instinctive sympathy
for the perfect innocence of animals
with an equally ardent carnivory.
Arms retreat guilt-free

through the widest breach
in the garment, having chosen a meal
the stauncher faiths call impassible,
withdrawing to empty folds.
I hope you feel safe when you die.
