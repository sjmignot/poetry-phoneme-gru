# Mother of People without Script
## Mai Der Vang
You swear the twin spirits
taught you to write.

At night, you climbed
the leaves to hear the gods.

Catch in the throat. Hollow breath.

 _Paj_ is not _pam_ is not _pab_.
    Blossom is not blanket is not help.

 _Ntug_ is not _ntuj_ is not _ntub_.
        Edge is not sky is not wet.

On sheet of bamboo
with indigo branch.

      To _txiav_ is not the _txias_.
           To scissor is not the cold.

The obsidian mask
will make its own sleep,

leave behind the silver
your body won’t shed.

Now you are _Niam Ntawv_
who was once a young farmer

scrawling in secret toward
the triggering day.

When they could take no more,
when all that you had was given,

you lined your grave with paper.
