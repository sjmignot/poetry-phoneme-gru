# Salt
## Huang Fan
and [Margaret Ross
Grain by grain, salt’s frozen tears
Help me count history’s disasters
I can’t blame salt for telling food
 _You’re full of wounds_

Salt misses the freedom of the ocean
Remembering waves, salt jumps into a soup
But it finds there only my reflected face
It hides by making itself too soft to chew

Sometimes, salt follows a cold sweat
Waking me from a nightmare
Dreamed blood tastes like salt
As if in human failure lay the silence of God

Having swum in the ocean
Salt considers soup a shallow pond
For salt, every meal is a jail

One day, an extra salty flavor
Makes me cough and cough
It feels like cold fish bones scraping my throat
Maybe it’s salt telling me
 _I’m going to prison in your body
_
Don’t ever forget who I am!
_Translated from the Chinese_
