# One Afternoon
## Joanie Mackowski
A woman stepped outside, crumbled
into a loose particulate, and, as the breeze
blew up from the east, she scattered: her handful
of heart, volcanic ash, spiraled the highway,
and five of her teeth slipped between
her neighbor's breasts; her neighbor
unbuttoned her blouse to scratch
at her suddenly red and luminous skin.
Days passed. Each day the sun distractedly
drifted from chair to chair; each night the stars,
old scatterbrains, they commiserated.
It didn't rain. _Strange_ , the granular woman
thought to herself: _although I encompass_
 _so much, I accomplish so little_.
Her car sparkled with her hair and bones;
her garden thrived. She tried to think:
 _why did this happen? what had I eaten?_
 _why was I bothered?_ â€”those old hours,
spotted and exotic lizards, darted
the gravel, flicking through their colors
of skin as one flicks channels on a tv.
She couldn't catch a one. Then, as a flock
of sparrows converging for the skull
of an oak, all her twittering dust,
her brain, bone, and the dangerous shreds
of her fingers clawed for the sky;
 _what an interesting cloud_ someone said.
