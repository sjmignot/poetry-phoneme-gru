 -- Way on back through the underwood by Bowen's Canal
Well we’d heard it to be veiny with cottonmouths I’m not gonna lie.

  •

For true
the sheer (snake-electric) back-beyond of the place
put a pull on us like a magnet.


  •


That that rag-rope (flagged and) barred the path just egged us on.


  •


(To go and
skulk- and sidle-learn
to palp and tap the edge
to crack us in.)


  •


— What’d we feel there once we’d crossed?


  •


Veritable
thought-thick trunks
of swampfoot oaks.


  •


Something like ‘ _a shift in the structure of experience._ ’


  •


Here was
Johnny Pep (shrapped home from war)
branch-dragging
agglomerating discards and disjecta.


  •


His craving wove a plexus (more a house) from limbs and leaves.


  •


He knit us in:
he left us be.   He let us watch he watched us try
(to climb to ape his crisscross weave)
to pitch to plait the roof.


  •


Something like ‘ _Yall strayboys welcome to be welcome if you work._ ’


  •


Didn’t we ‘work’ —
particular night-hoots (and near-chromatic whistle-riffs) in echo; likenesses
he whittled live from hickory showed us how.


  •


He’d let us
watch him strip and shave
the shagbark bark
to taste (to read) to mull the grain.


  •


Something like ‘ _root-room_ ’ I reckon.   Something like


  •


‘ _When Johnny Pep hitched home from war_
 _we took to carving (curing) scraplings into shapes._ ’
