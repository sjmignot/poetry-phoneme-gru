In Calgary
I saw a man break a dog's back.

In Calgary
I saw a man marry money
 _Who giveth this money?_
the commissioner asked
The man said
 _Everyone who works for me_
The commissioner asked
 _Where are they? I don’t hear them declare it_
The man said _That’s not their job_
 _You do yours_

 _Do you take this money_
the commissioner asked
 _to have and to hold
_
till death do you part?
The man replied
 _Even longer_
The commissioner said
 _Money, do you take this man
_
et cetera?
Money said nothing
but the man said _It’s my money
_
Our opinions are identical

In that case
the commissioner said
 _I hereby pronounce you one flesh_

 _You heard the commissioner_
the man said
 _What authority has joined together
_
let nobody dare separate
Got that?
All of us, including money
were silent

In Calgary
I saw the toe of a cowboy boot
rupture the spleen of a man begging

iii

In Calgary
I heard a man praise his snow machine
how he and his friends like to have a few
then compete who can steer their Ski-Doo
farthest up their piles of money
—high-marking, they call it
the sled almost vertical
so the man, drunk, stands up on the footrests
as he climbs
 _Fuck yes, it’s dangerous_

Two or three machines a month
trigger at the apex
a vast roaring slab of money
that descends with the consistency
of cement, impossible to outrun
entombing the perpetrator
 _Dumb fuck should have been more careful_

iv

In Calgary
I saw a man fire another man
by inviting him to a conference room
where an employee from HR waited
with severance paperwork and a payment
along with someone from security
to escort immediately out of the building
the man whose livelihood
had just been stripped
 _We don’t want no trouble_

v

In Calgary
I watched money overflow the banks along the Bow
sweeping hundreds of replicas of the same ample house
out onto wheat fields
surrounding the city
Saw the flood pour into downtown streets
office towers, machine shops
oil well equipment yards
sending the inhabitants scrambling
to survive
 _Dog eat dog and I’m hungry_

I watched the current surge into libraries
galleries, museums
to jumble, bury under debris
permanently stain
I saw couples in a bar
trying to two-step
slipping and stumbling into each other
due to the money pooled
on the floor

vi

In Calgary
during a Wild West wagon race
I saw a horse sprawl to the ground
heard the snap: leg broke
the animal finished
in Calgary

vii

And I heard a woman sobbing
how money had always been
her family’s friend
provided heat and light
consoling, comforting until
suddenly it behaved as if envious
of the little they had: ATV
wakeboarding boat
and trailer, dually
the Lexus
—each as if transformed to dust
or ash
she gasped as she wept

 _Money now hates us_
took the new smartphones
bought each year, the son’s
Xbox and PlayStation
the daughter’s charter of a
party limo for her birthday
Christmases in Hawai’i
vacation condo in Mesa
Arizona
 _for no reason
_
Money hates our
way of life, wants to destroy
our freedom
 _Yours, too_ she sniffled
 _You have to help us_
