# All Kinds of Fires Inside Our Heads
## Nikki Wallschlaeger
The number of bodies i have
is equal to the number of
gurney transfers that are
televised.

If we’re all “just human”
then who is responsible?

A fire station drying out
from addiction. outside
the drizzling of firepower,
lowballing suns

it’s like a sauna in here.
the strain of a charred
bladder. bottled water
bad wiring,

that spark is no good
come sit with me for a
minute. my feet full of
diluted axe fluid

thought I heard you say
everything is medicine
but that’s just hearin
what you wanna hear
