The Powers-that-Be decreed that from the—of—the sausage rolls, for reasons
Of security, would be contracted to a different firm. They gave the prisoners
no reasons.

The prisoners complained. We cannot reproduce his actual words here, since
their spokesman is alleged
To be a sub-commander of a movement deemed to be illegal.

An actor spoke for him in almost-perfect lip-synch: _It’s not the quality_
_We’re giving off about. Just that it seems they’re getting smaller. We’re
talking quantity_.

His ‘Belfast’ accent wasn’t West enough. Is the _H_ in H-Block _aitch_ or
_haitch_?
Does it matter? _What we have we hold_? _Our day will come_? Give or take an
inch?

Well, give an inch and someone takes an effing mile. Everything is in the ways
You say them. Like, the prison that we call Long Kesh is to the Powers-that-Be
_The Maze_.
