# Reflection
## Elizabeth Arnold
I said

no to you
so often, couldn't see.

Do you know how that

changed you
â€"divided

what you saw in me

or anything
(if you did)

from what you

said
or mostly

didn't?

And another bottle
drained,

your head

lolling off the chair's back,
the mirror's

face blacked.
