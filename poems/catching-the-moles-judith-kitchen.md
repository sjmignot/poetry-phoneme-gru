# Catching the Moles
## Judith Kitchen
First we tamp down the ridges
that criss-cross the yard

then wait for the ground
to move again.

I hold the shoe box,
you, the trowel.

When I give you the signal
you dig in behind

and flip forward.
Out he pops into daylight,

blind velvet.

We nudge him into the box,
carry him down the hill.

Four times we’ve done it.
The children worry.

_Have we let them all go_
_at the very same spot?_

_Will they find each other?_
We can’t be sure ourselves,

only just beginning to learn
the fragile rules of uprooting.
