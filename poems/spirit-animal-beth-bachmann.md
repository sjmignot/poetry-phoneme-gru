# spirit animal
## Beth Bachmann
three times the snake appeared before me & like a gun said follow when you
hear fire keep your body close to the ground the snake said point blank I am
here for your protection I don’t have a trigger but I have a tongue to your
neck to your ear to your temple follow me down the barrel three shots to
steady ready the gray-­eyed snake spit warming its body along the crack you
can’t go back from where you are unarmed handle the snake the way you handle a
gun at your belt with a glove spirit guide the gun away from the body follow
each bone as it moves up & down the back
