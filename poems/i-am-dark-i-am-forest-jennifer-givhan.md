# I am dark, I am forest
## Jennifer Givhan
After Rilke
I carried a bowl of menudo into the forest / I carried my bisabuela’s tripas
not daring ask whose intestines I carried / con cilantro y radish y cebolla
chopped fine / I carried the sewing machine they’d chained her to in the
garment district downtown I carried the forest crackling against asphalt where
her chanclas burnt & melted so I carried her too / I wore no red / I bore no
basket / there was no forest but an avocado tree in the backyard of the house
they made her sell to get her Medicare for her diabetes shots / I carried her
sugarwater / a hummingbird great-granddaughter I carried her flickering / her
black-  & white-screened / I carried her face / the scars her warped esposo
left her granddaughter / carried those wounds through the womb / not wolf but
blue-eyed man / I stirred the menudo / my belly the pot / & scalding into the
forest I carried / & that tree I chopped down chopped into a boat & carried my
mother & my bisabuela across the chile-red sopa the blood-water broth / named
her daughter / what forest have we made for her I cannot see / I carried
darkness into the forest & sliced it out.
