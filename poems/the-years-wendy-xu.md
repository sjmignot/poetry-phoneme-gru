# The Years
## Wendy Xu
Such were they, a dumb stuffed thing
to say, if truth is we all grow old un-

observed, limbs flail only halfway up
a flight, where does dark begin settling

my little bones. I dream and do love
to have them, blue fish

in a lake, my head more tipped up than down
under damp earth. Some days others like deer

from the shot, peeled back, how I
find trees dressed in wild

green light. The years come, unstitched
a face, saddled as one would a heavy beast

for walking. Likely I became then a member
of heaven, put up, the years come and reaching

their long wet hands.
