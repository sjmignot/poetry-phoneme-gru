# Hearing That   Joe Arroyo Song at Ibiza Nightclub, 2008
## Elizabeth Acevedo
A boy I did not marry                  taught me to dance salsa on 2
placed
the fingers of his left hand            on my untutored spine;
you know what
it’s like to become someone’s clave


to love for the span           of the trombone’s long breath
he      whispered
 _negra_ so I spun                my heart landing            on     the
rum-covered     linoleum
of a nightclub


on what used to be New York Ave              in what used to be Chocolate City
I let him turn  & spin                                 my name
_bella negra_
             his hands were less tender but still I let them roam


              when I                   _1, 2, 3_               _5, 6, 7_
in front of my mirror
I was always la negra defended in the lyric                       and     you
can     forgive
searching hands when a mouth swells the biggest ache of your body

into song
