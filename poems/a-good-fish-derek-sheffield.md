# A Good Fish
## Derek Sheffield
_Jerk that bitch_ , urges my guide,
and I give my shuddering pole
a jerk, hooking the throat
of the first steelhead of my life.
_Reel 'em_ , he mutters and revs the motor.
I horse my pole and reel and horse.
The boat's mascot whines, her claws
clicking. _Let it take some line._
My father, uncle, and cousin
are reeling. _First fish!_ they shout,
and I shout, _What a fighter!_
A silver spine touches the air.
_There_ , he points, _a hen. And guess what?_
_She's gonna join the club_ ,
somehow spotting in that glimpse
the smooth place along her back
where a fin had been snipped.
He leans over the gunwale, dips a net,
and scoops her into the boat.
She is thick with a wide band
of fiery scales, slap-
slapping the aluminum bottom.
_Welcome to the club_ , he says,
and clobbers her once, and again,
and once more before she goes still.
_A bleeder_ , he says, shaking his head
and handing her to me. I curl
a finger through a gill the way
you're supposed to, determined
not to let her slip and flop
back to the river, a blunder
I'd never live down. A good fist.
Fish, I mean. A good fish.
