# On Making
## Rebecca Morgan Frank
I held a jackhammer once.
It matched me

in height and weight and I
planned destruction, ripped

everything solid from the ground.
The concrete was my prey,

but it was the tool I fought
to master, its metal body

trembling beneath my hands.
Or, perhaps, its electric heart

was what shook me through
my last held bones.

The concrete, gone,
the rented machinery, returnedâ€”

and I wondered if Sisyphus had imagined
a garden where the rock came from.
