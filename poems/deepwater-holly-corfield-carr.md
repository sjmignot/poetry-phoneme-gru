## Holly Corfield Carr
I have my father’s hair. _Not much of a gift,
_
chick, but can’t say I’m not generous.
     Thick cloud blasting out of my head,
          fat as baleen. _The word_ , his tongue slugs
against the roof of his mouth, _is adsorbant_ ,
    and he insists on the prefix in a coda of clicks:
           _ad-_ __ ad-     ad’yer see? like a whale, spearing
its noise into the dark. _Grows like bone,_
 _does hair_ , strengthens against stress, all our
          violences legible in horn, hoof, feather,
the warm ocher of his thumbnail as he turns
    the beak over. I am naked, watching the plug
          braid a borehole, my fragrant grief: tobacco, lanolin,
bacon spit, grease. And he is starting to plait my wet hair,
    passing forward fresh streams to dark slick
          over my shoulders and asking me to guess the weight
of disaster. Absently, I count a kink from flu, a thickening
    for love, golden crown and here, at the root, a length of gray.
           _You tell by the color of the waves_ , he shrugs, walks
to his bookshelf on the landing, holds out a finger, divines
    red, black, hardback, glaucous, yellow spine torn, a gap:
          here, between books, he leaves the kittiwake beak
after dabbing it like a glass pipette at my cheek.
 _Ab_ acinate. _Ab_ scess. _Ab_ yss. _Ab_ ovo. _At Macondo_ , he reads
           _people sent sponges, lambs’ wool, soil, books, anything
_
at all bibulous to save them. In the end, they shaved
 _the little girls, bagged their hair to make a gluey boom,_
           _suck it up, the spoils_. He starts to towel me down, tells me
that’s what happens to naughty children, guides my feet
    into my socks and the kittiwake beak, his grim memento,
          watches through nostrils, observes our wincing fractures.
My hair dries, keratin core still recording a damaged archive
    of  him, katabatic debris, red algae, bad blood cut
          in cross sections of arctic ice. But they didn’t
use any of it. They used their own ends to end the spill:
    propylene sacks sent to drink its own kin. _Ad_ absurdum. _Ad_ fin.
 _Ad_ creep. _Ad_ agio. _Ad_ am. I asked him what happened to all the hair,
          but he said that’s not the point of the story.
