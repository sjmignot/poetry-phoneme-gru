# The Robin Makes a Laughing Sound
## Sallie Wolf
The robin makes a laughing sound.
It makes me stop and look around
to see just what the robin seesâ€”
fresh new leaves on twigs of trees,
a strong, high branch on which to rest,
a safe dry ledge to hold its nest.
The robin makes a laughing sound.
I stop. I always look around.
