# There's a Limbo Moon Above
## Beth Bachmann
The best-known German goldsmith of the sixteenth century, Wenzel Jamnitzer, is
also remembered for his study of the five platonic solids, _Perspectives of
Regular Bodies_ , in which he proposed that out of the same five bodies one
can go on endlessly making all other bodies.

The five solids originate with Pythagoras, but are named after Plato, who
paired four of the five solids with each of the four elements and the fifth
with heaven to make up the difference: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air),
cube (earth), icosahedron (water), and dodecahedron (heaven).

The idea is that the universe is made up of a handful of shapes and out of
these shapes other shapes are made.

In a letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Nobel Prize Committee,
Chubby Checker claimed to have invented the dance that begat all other modern
dances.

Speaking of himself in third person he wrote, “Chubby Checker changed
everything. He gave movement to a music that never had this movement before.
The styles changed. The nightclub scene is forever changed. Checker gave birth
to aerobics.”

The song originally called “What a monotonous melody,” written in five minutes
on a dare, begat “Limbo Rock” begat “Let’s Limbo Some More” begat “Mary Ann
Limbo” begat “Limbo Rock/Do the Limbo Rock,” as “The Twist” begat “Let’s Twist
Again” begat “Slow Twistin’” begat “Twist It Up” begat “The Twist (Yo,
Twist!).”

Checker calls his dance “dancing apart to the beat,” not dancing separate from
the beat, but two people dancing separate from one another.

“Limbo Rock” ends in a whistle.

Limbo, the dance, comes from Trinidad, where it was danced at wakes, but in
reverse: the bar began at the lowest height and was raised to symbolize a
rising from death into life.

Dante’s limbo is the best circle of Hell, all those unbaptized babies and old
philosophers to snuggle up with at night.

“Mary Ann Limbo” starts with a whistle.

 _All day, all night, Mary Ann
Down by the sea side siftin’ sand
Even little children love Mary Ann
Down by the seaside siftin’ sand_

Take a shape.

Repeat it — translate it, reflect it over a line, rotate it around a point —
and you’ve got symmetry.

Go, go, go, go: that’s it!

That’s gold.
