# Lullaby
## Maggie Dietz
After Lyle Lovett
If I had a ginko tree
I'd climb it in the evening.

If I had a marmoset
He'd climb the tree with me.

If we saw a falling star
I'd wish I had a rocket.

If I had a rocket
I'd drag the star back home.

If I went to space
I'd pick up a satellite.

If I had my own moon
I wouldn't be so sad.

If I weren't so sad
I wouldn't need a companion.

If I sold my marmoset
I'd have a lot of cash.

If I had some money
I'd buy an Eldorado.

(Silver, 1959,
With fins like raptor wings.)

I'd shine that Eldorado
and drive it to my father's.

If I had a father
I'd take him for a ride.
