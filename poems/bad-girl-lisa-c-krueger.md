# Bad Girl
## Lisa C. Krueger
When she was ten her father left her
at a Denny’s— _You’ll get back._

She walked the other way for miles
before a car pulled over, a man shouted

 _You are lost,_ opened his door to her.
Beyond him was darkness.

No lights, no signs, no people
telling her what to do:

she kept walking. Upright, strident,
terrified by her act.

Terrified she was bad
for saving herself.
