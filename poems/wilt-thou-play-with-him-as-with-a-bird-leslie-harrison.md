# [Wilt thou play with him as with a bird]
## Leslie Harrison
For I have loved the blade with all my crippled

with all my awkward soul loved it for the shine

sheen for the ease and grace of doing what it was

made to do for I have loved the stubborn womb

its beloved intent have loved the hope and then

learned to love the lack for I have loved the water

the way it comes to me comes for me in all its

liquid mystery for I have loved what the water

loves its myriad vessels sky basin runnel channel

and vein for all it claims and contains for I have

loved its muscular flex its rise coil and fall so like

Leviathan's mighty desperate heart for I have loved

Leviathan for being only for being exactly

what god hated and what he made for being

water's own knife this wild unholy blade
