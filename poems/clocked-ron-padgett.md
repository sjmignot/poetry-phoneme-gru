I’m going to look at my watch
though I don’t really care what time it is.
Just slightly curious.
It’s funny when you see
it’s much earlier or later
than you thought,
but even funnier when it’s _exactly_
the time you thought.

But at my back etc.
 _Etc._ being
“Desarts of vast Eternity.”


I give up.
It’s eleven eleven.

What ever happens
at eleven eleven?
Vast eternity!
