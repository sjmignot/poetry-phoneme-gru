# The Hermit: 24

24.


Zachary talks about wanting to be with someone because he
feels like he can be a better person for someone else. He says he
doesn't know what he's doing, wishes he had someone to do
things for. I tell him I think we are very different people.



Theory as pure verbalism: a generated knowledge with
negative impact.



If I begin to miss someone, Â I think, "Life is bad anyway."
