# how to get over ["when the poem flirts..."]
## T'ai Freedom Ford
               for those of us who can't quite quit her
when the poem flirts
similes hugging her thighs

like a tight skirt: consider
the possibilities.

if the poem follows
you home, whiskey

pickling her tongue:
make her coffee, black.

if the poem arrives
dressed as metaphor,

begging for candy: trick
or retreat till the mask falls.

should the poem slink
outta panties, stand

naked demanding touch:
finger her lines

till her stanzas beg
for an encore: come

again, explore, imagine odd
positions of sweet revision.

and whenever she whispers,
 _stop_ : listen and leave her be.
