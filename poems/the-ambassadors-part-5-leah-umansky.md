# The Ambassadors -- Part 5

This is a poured-truth dressed in memory
and cut down; this is a matter ruff; a gray middle
the world is in flight and many things circle.

_What world do you want me in?_ I ask.


But I am confronted with touch, the work of hand and eye,
and a kept-remark roaming ...
_When in Rome_ , I think.

 _A dressed-memory_ : never did more frill mean curtained-silence.

_Hello?_
_Weâ€™re here_ , they say.


I remember the moment first-harvested: no possible brimming is
ever frank. At that age, who knew filth could be forward. I thought
I could cut it down.

Look, the leaping is possible, I think. I watch the way evening attaches
to us. See its starting point? It banded, uncontrolled and gleaming.
Our jewel. Not all worlds see the darkness.
Remember: the world is good, that leaping center is a tuned heart.
I want that melody.

 _What world do you want me in, now?_ I ask
I feel broad-throated, and slippy.
I say, _tell me the times the chronicle mentions me._

_56_ , she says.


_Let me be clear: I knew._ I said, _I knew. I wanted to have my own grown
romance._
_Plant me another. Do it now._
