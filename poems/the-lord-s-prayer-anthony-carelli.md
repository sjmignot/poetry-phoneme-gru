# The Lord's Prayer
## Anthony Carelli
You can't fake it. You know when I fail
          to achieve the expected: palm the becoming-
                         comatose bullfrog, legs collapsing as they may,
and _chuck_ it (we used to say) high as you can.

Let it fly stone-like to the skylight in the low
          dome of fog—another requirement of the game:
                    a foggy day and a bullfrog and you, Vincent.
The old code goes back and forth between us

as we take our turns, childhood pals, engaged
           by the game we once called Kamikaze—now,
                         a nameless ceremony. Nameless not because
a boy's play calcifies in a man's conviction;

not because, despite our promise, you've become
          a mid-rank fighter pilot, and I a minor poet;
                        and not because it's too unpleasant to name
what brings to hand that astonished muscle

only to leave it, later, sprawled on the current.
          The perfect toss sends the critter shattering
                         for an instant, beyond fog, into the invisible.
Disappearance is success. Once you said, "My insides

tickle whenever it happens," and so I know
          you've been tickled five times, and I three.
                    That's the score; the score matters little.
The name is gone because we're _from_ here,

and, being native, cannot visit how it is
         that an urge to which we tend tends to us—
                       how we are cruel, inscrutable, indefensible,
yet holy. How we send up bodies of praise from

our right hand, only to gather eventual elegies—
          flesh stunned still as words—in our left.
                    Once again the center of the heavens
is earth. We've thrown as high as we can

for as long as we can remember, only to await
          some return: a revelation, plummet, explosive
                         splash. So it is that two grown men
may stand again in stillness, awaiting word,

friends who glimpse for seconds at a time
          earth as it is in heaven, ankle-deep
                          in Rowan Creek with eyes uplifted,
reflecting the fog to the fog itself.
