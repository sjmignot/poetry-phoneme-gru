# My Mother Worries About My Hat
## Richard Jarrette
Every spring my mother says I should buy a straw
hat so I won't overheat in summer.

I always agree but the valley's soon cold, and besides
my old Borsalino is nearly rain-proof.

She's at it again, it's August, the grapes are sugaring.
I say, _Okay_ , and pluck a little spider from her hairâ€"

hair so fine it can't hold even one of her grandmother's
tortoise shell combs.
