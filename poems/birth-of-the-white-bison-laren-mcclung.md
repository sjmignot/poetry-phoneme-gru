# Birth of the White Bison
## Laren McClung
In the age of the fish, cobblestones
shift through a square & in hand turn

old weapon — beyond the city an ocean
swings in pelicans & spinner dolphins,

leaves them on the Peruvian shore, or
in a small town two thousand blackbirds fall

from the Arkansas sky “just like last year” —

but far off in the silence of the rural plains
this cow wallows on a grassy mound

till a muzzle merges from another world,
onlookers gawk along a picket fence

as she pushes the head & two hooves
& then stands to open for the calf

that makes way with a message —
a woman in the shape of a cloud saying

 _return to your people & tell them I am coming_.
