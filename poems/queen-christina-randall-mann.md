# Queen Christina
## Randall Mann
To celebrate his final Pride, in June,
my friend, lymphatic, thin, and in distress,
managed to dress in drag. He shot the moon:
outstretched, he’d used his dying to think—obsess—

about the Prada pumps, their skin a snake;
the heavy pantyhose, two pair; the moot
but lacy underthings; the makeup, cake,
to overlay his pain. I called him _beaut_ -

_i-ful_ ; he said he felt like Greta Garbo
in _Queen Christina_ (our campy interplay);
I countered that he looked more like a hobo-
sexual in heels. We howled. That day,

we never left his Castro flat. His rhinestone
glittered, and everywhere, the smell of cologne.
