whenever he tried to download _Blonde_. He would be
searched for f-bombs but not for h-e-

be Tasered for balling his Whopper wrapper

interest rates. He would get his shoes polished
at the airport if the kiosk weren’t so far
from the platinum members’ lounge. He would
be placed on paid leave if  he raped the trainee
from Dawson. Sexually assaulted. Allegedly.
