# With a Swoop
## Uche Nduka
It wouldn't kill me
to find new frequencies
in a temper tantrum.

Tatamis and memory,
magnetized selves
becoming heavy.

Of what is a scream composed?
You may want to know.

You may want to know why.

It is to these arabesques
that the birdsong
replies.

Copula, disappear.
Anguish, multifoliate.
I am a brother to a wandering prayer.

Orb in ruined loop
fluting for a lost future.

I grab what is left of pistons
bouncing across a street.

The barricade is foolproof.
