# First Blues
## Saundra Rose Maley
That summer night
Was hot
Steaming like a crab
Luscious under the shell

Televisions gone bleary
Blinked
In front of men
In undershirts drinking beer

Wives upstairs took showers
Caught
A glimpse of their backs
In hallway mirrors

I sat in the dark
Invisible
On the backporch
Drinking in the night

And it tasted good
So good
Going down
And somebody like me

Blew night through an alto sax
Blew and blew
His cooling breath
His hot cool breath on meâ€”

And I came alive
Glowing
In the dark
Listening like a fool
