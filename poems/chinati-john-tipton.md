Welcome to Texas, Devin Johnston,
a windmill has your nameâ€”
stubborn and American at off-rhyme
to the arroyo-creased, angular region.
Bald, redheaded turkey buzzards eat
a rabbit struck by what
it only understood as supernatural.
The birds bring to mind
black grasshoppers that broke clacking
into red-winged and rasping darts.
And even as we drive
secular sunlight polishes aluminum slantwise.
