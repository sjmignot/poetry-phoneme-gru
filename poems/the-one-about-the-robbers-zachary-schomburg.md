# The One About the Robbers
## Zachary Schomburg
You tell me a joke about two robbers who hide from the police. One robber
hides as a sack of cats and the other robber hides as a sack of potatoes. That
is the punch line somehow, the sack of potatoes, but all I can think about is
how my dad used to throw me over his shoulder when I was very small and call
me his sack of potatoes. _I've got a sack of potatoes_ he would yell, spinning
around in a circle, the arm not holding me reaching out for a sale. _Does
anyone want to buy my sack of potatoes?_ No one ever wanted to buy me. We were
always the only two people in the room.
