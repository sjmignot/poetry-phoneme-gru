## Benjamin Franklin
Man’s rich with little, were his Judgment true,
Nature is frugal, and her Wants are few;
Those few Wants answer’d, bring sincere Delights,
But Fools create themselves new Appetites.
Fancy and Pride seek Things at vast Expence,
Which relish not to  _Reason_  nor to  _Sense_
Like Cats in Airpumps, to subsist we strive
On Joys too thin to keep the Soul alive.
