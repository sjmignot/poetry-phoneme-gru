# Captain Haddock vs. the PTA
## Amy Beeder
Bewildered Saint of the curse, bulbous
_&_ profane, I invoke you against this _Nest_
_Of Lice & Vipers_: O volcanic Captain, I implore you, pour
Your scorn upon these _Borgias_ ; before these _Braggarts_
Unfurl your thick invective, show your bullet head
Whiskey-pickled, weathered & pupilless, sweating
In a bantam rage, your sad-fish face a fist;
 _Ostrogothic_ versus the matrons
Voluble against the _Vampireâ€™s_ slander
Because I would never say _Vivisectionist_ to her face
While you old Captain Fatstock, Hopscotch, Havoc
Denouncer of _Bullies_ , _Knitters & Bandits_
Live to make the air around you frantic
To spill your black lake of _Cannibal_ ink.
