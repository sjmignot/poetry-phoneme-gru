First:       Brother, remove the tool marks on your scathed skin, brush your
tattoos with
                                   nettles, smear bearberry juice in the
gashes. Crack open the jail-seed.

Second:   Tear away the bars which restrain
                                   your lean, spare life. Bend your curves in
a knot. Brother, smudge your
                                   saw-tooth edges.

Third:      Cut red seaweed to conceal your gray cadaver;
                                   start wetting your skin down; after
scraping,
                                   drip your bowels of blood, change into
wolf.

Fourth:    The savannah sparrow flies north.
                                   In speech, smell fine-grained hawthorn.
                                   Collapse your voice into bark and howl.
