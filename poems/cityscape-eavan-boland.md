# Cityscape
## Eavan Boland
I have a word for it —
the way the surface waited all day
to be a silvery pause between sky and city —
which is _elver_.

And another one for how
the bay shelved cirrus clouds
piled up at the edge of the Irish Sea,
which is _elver_ too.

The old Blackrock baths
have been neglected now for fifty years,
fine cracks in the tiles
visible as they never were when

 _I can I can I can_
shouted Harry Vernon as
he dived from the highest board
curving down into salt and urine

his cry fading out
through the half century it took
to hear as a child that a glass eel
had been seen

entering the seawater baths at twilight —
also known as _elver_  —
and immediately
the word begins

a delicate migration —
a fine crazing healing in the tiles —
the sky deepening above a city
that has always been

unsettled between sluice gates and the Irish Sea
to which there now comes at dusk
a translucent visitor
yearning for the estuary.
