# A Penitent Considers Another Coming of Mary
## Gwendolyn Brooks
For Reverend Theodore Richardson
If Mary came would Mary
Forgive, as Mothers may,
And sad and second Saviour
Furnish us today?

She would not shake her head and leave
This military air,
But ratify a modern hay,
And put her Baby there.

Mary would not punish menâ€"
If Mary came again.
