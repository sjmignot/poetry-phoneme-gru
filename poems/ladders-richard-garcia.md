# Ladders
## Richard Garcia
First the people had to invent ladders. No one had ever seen a ladder. Once
they had ladders they invented walls to climb over. Soon they realized it took
two ladders to climb a wall. One to climb up one sideâ€”one to climb down the
other. People would ascend one side of the wall, descend the other side of the
wall, and then walk away, leaving the ladders behind. That is why there are so
many ladders in the world. The ladders are picked up and stored in an enormous
warehouse. Scientists have proposed attaching all the ladders, one on top of
the other, creating an elevator into outer space. Some people want to destroy
all the ladders. Others want to destroy the walls. Others say that someday we
are going to need all the ladders in the world.
