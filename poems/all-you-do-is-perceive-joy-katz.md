# All You Do Is Perceive
## Joy Katz
I was given a city, with coffee and sunlight. “The coin-purse smell of the
subway,” I wrote. In the mornings policemen would stand, lightstruck and
pleasured, over trays of danish. Mornings I wrote and workmen raised up their
nets. Hallelujah the brick, the debris! I was given a city. The city got
between me and God.

I was given a house. The curtains breathed over wide sills. There was a leaf
in the middle of the floor, I loved the crispness of the leaf. I loved the
privacy of sills. The sills sailed, I fell into the sills. The sills got
between me and God.

I was given a mud hut. The walls curved to meet the ceiling like a tongue
curves to make a word.

I was given God, with salt and sweet together. I was given a piece of meat. I
loved the flesh. I was given bread only. I was given only water. I loved the
coolness of the water. The water got between me and the feast.

I had an empty plate and there was the color of it. I cannot even describe the
color of it.

I was given a cell with a window. There was a certain light at evening.

I was given nothing but the air, and the air dazzled.
