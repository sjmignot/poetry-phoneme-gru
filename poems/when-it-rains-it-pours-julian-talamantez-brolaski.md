# when it rains it pours
## Julian Talamantez Brolaski
when it rains it pours
the rain it raineth everyday
pull up the reins, rayned in by reason, rule, and reverence
if the aim is total abject embarrassment
of shiny-looking objects tenderly gathered for the pome’s
sunset quinceañera
a star winked at me btwn the apricot and the cypress
2 crows atop them like a punter on the mizzenmast
u better step up your game, havelok
by what means of studye and devocyon
what is love but a constellation
of significances
it liked to eat salmon w/ its fingers like a bear
and then use those
fingers to clean its glasses
it cries and it looks like a wolf   I believe it wanted
to cultivate this look
