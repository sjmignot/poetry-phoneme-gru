# Handed the Rain
## Ed Roberson
given to
look into    the bowl
of sky

for it to fill
with future
see it turned

upside down on the grass
see the ladle pass

hear the god underneath
calling his inside
the heavenly vault    eternal

how that bump
reminds me    how we saw it
once

from the underside of
Nut    a mother's belly


see dissolve
against her vast ground
the drowned cloud of black

lives    the solution's population
of rain crowding the city
in the belly

see it now as the sea extended
the drowned city     lit     in this sky


see our sky
the bone clouds casting
African

tomorrows   only
an arm    black balletic cloud
extends itself

dark nimbic
invertebrate squall


I am handed rain
by a portuguese man-o-war
These are

new skies
once we absorb the seas'
solution as the bodies lost

the sting
fire of lightning    flesh


the water
body
air

we drown together
in our living
to drink

from this
bone
