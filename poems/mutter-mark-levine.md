# Mutter
## Mark Levine
There is a brand of play called muteness
Beneath the play yard’s interlacing branches.

It appeals to children born
 Entre deux guerres, whose specialty it is.

   It is mutiny; that is, a tongue
  Of foreign origin ending in grunts.

 One such child uses his tongue
On a frozen fence for the embrace of it

For the mutating appendage makes of speech
 A combat; an internment.

There is a brand of child assisted to the play yard
By his keeper fussing with his zipper.

  Yes, it is cold in the high hemisphere
And nothing will be the death of him

As he sets hard sweets on his tongue
 He neither chews nor swallows.

 Such children can never swing too freely
  From the elm’s loping barkless arm.

 It is mutual. There is smoke on the air, tarry,
  Commuting the industry on high

As the children simmer within
Their word-cloud.

 And someone or something is calling them home
A familiar voice, if they have one.
