Wounded Knee
Years since I’d been back
to the memorial; I’d forgotten

it was up on a rise above
the killing ground. Two kids

appeared in the dust with things
to sell—once coming from the far

end of the chain-link, two kinds
of dream-catchers hanging

from his arm; and the girl, hunched
on the broken steps under

the arch’s improbable cross, cradling
a Tupperware bowl of beaded

star-necklaces in her lap. Her pink-
and-silver t-shirt read PRINCESS.

I shut my car door, and a grouse
startled off the fence, veered away

over bent switchgrass. The girl—
Allie—said her little sisters made

the jewelry, in the gray house
at the base of the hill; maybe

her price included the pictures I
walked behind her to take: the marker

for 1890, then the more recent
graves, in ground seared and

hardpanned by wind and snow and
desolation; tied, bandana-pouches

of tobacco, and ribbons, like fists
and fingers shifting and fluttering;

a few tough bright flowers left;
gray-blue sky rolling above

to the edges of horizon all around,
spitting, cooking up a storm.

I stood and turned back toward
the arch again, where Allie and

her friend, if he was a friend, hadn’t
spoken a word to one another.

For the first time in my life
I wished I’d had some cigarettes—

to smoke with them, at least offer,
something to do with strangers you

might sit a while beside till maybe
one of you thought of something

to say. A little thunder crackled,
and we said goodbye; I drove on

toward the shaft of rain above
Manderson.  No reason to think I’d

be any memory to them; a dream-
catcher sold, a brilliant blue

necklace. I passed a knocked-over
 _vote Democrat_ sign, and two younger

kids working on a bike upside-down,
and remembered the small bowls,

empty now, brought and offered
at the graves surrounded for miles

by graves never found. Rain would
fill them, lift the reservoirs, clear

the air. I thought of reaching over
to pop the camera-back open; turned

from dirt onto narrow blacktop,
the road out, that was steaming.
