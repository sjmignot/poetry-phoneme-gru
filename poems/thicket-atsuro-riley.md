# Thicket
## Atsuro Riley
We come gnawed by need on hands and knees.


As a creature (nosing) grubble-seeks a spring.


As bendy-spined as bandy snakes through saltshrub yaupon
needle-brake.


For darkling green;
for thorn-surround.


This absorbing


quaggy
crample-ground.


Of   briar-canes (intervolved with kudzu-mesh) and mold.


Of   these convoluted vines we grasp to suck.


To taste the pith —
the lumen the cell-sap pulse.


To try to know


some (soursharp) something about something.


 _Lumen is as lumen does.
_


‘A little room for turmoil to grow lucid in.’


In here _where_ _Clary set her cart-tongue down_ (and dug, and brailled).
In here where Tynan breathed.


We grasp to suck to taste what light.


Let loose the bale that bows us down.


— Bow down.
