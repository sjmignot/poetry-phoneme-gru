# From "Architektonis: Twenty for the Chicago Architecture Center"
## Ed Roberson
That [science] which treats of those conditions of knowledge which lie in the
nature, not of thought itself, but of that which we think about ... has been
called ...  _Architectonic_ , in so far as it treats of the method of building
up our observations into system.
_-- Sir William Hamilton _
_...  one of which systems is a poem._
1\. what the chicago window was for

mainly light.

      the supporting function
on the sides      opens to let in
      air.      the proportion
wall to door   dependent on heat.

      repeated upward
into cold      wind
      around the columns
and garland
      sky high   reflections off the face of their

investment   the blueprint raises money longer
      hours   profit piles up

the american beauty    of  work   yourself
      to death to look out on.


2\. otis

railroad architecture ran elevators
off the ground to get weight it needed up
like people off land to get over      then
an elevator railroad floated architecture
up floors open as plains to the sky
through walls into rooms coupled like cars
to each other without a climb
hallway distances like vistas through
zigzag mountain valleys as work’s landscape
the first time since walking sheep in the cloud
meadows far away from the later smoke
the elevators laid more meadow out
than the mountain had basis for
its little square created acreage out of air.


more than the fiery iron horse   the hidden
legged spider wove worlds more tightly into
her realm of feeding upon   more needed
immediately   she trained her fare
into catching her by waiting for her to swallow
the fat rides she needed to keep her moving.
and moving faster with no feeling
of movement   she has architecture anesthetized
to no other way   as long as there is up
it will feed her with it.
she has learned
how to go streetwise   through airports
she tells you when
the moving walkway is ending.


3.

the rookery
was built out of birds
which were actually
individual flames

not really
birds with fiery plumage
they stood out against
the masonry of black smoke

all that survived the fire.   I have
that x-periential thing about fire that makes me crazy
at even the thought of it   I  x.
so the idea of the city

having only this place for birds to land after
took me a long time to visit.


the difference between locate    _identify_
 _know something about_   and visit
 _re-experience   identify with_         is
in if   the roosts that become return   call back a sky

unclear how much what’s left
tells that much
about what has been lost   enough
to nest its shard against which tomorrow lies best

living its death until death is shown the lie
it lives into life.   it stirs
nothing suddenly.   more the politicking of birds
found a place to buy

and sell    the audacity
to have survived.   as the architectonic of a city.


4\. any programmable hall

crown hall is a lyric
miniature of bridge
el and street-stacking
engineering.

railroad
building   to art song.
the base   work. the columns
of profit.   and a capital.

the vast empty spaces
re-created
inside are potential.
what ended frankenstein   always waiting

to be given life   it already has.
any programmable hall   a machine.


but these are new life
designing already
itself      piece
by piece      cell

to embody   back maybe even
the species that crashed
into the vast invisible window
walls   in their migrations.

the artificial intelligence of walls
in the first place   that beheld us in
to our cathedral
now   to other worlds

out of the darkness.   the light
the open.   in their way   the intelligence.


5\. against all that square straight up

the hancock leans away in all
      faced direction from you
to the side   up ahead
      the darkness so strictly structured
it erupts in a gusher of sky   pure
      american   brought in

against all that square straight up
      drill   out on the plain of it    all x-ed out
into simple
      optimistic shift of dimension.

all tapering has its vanishing point.
      infinity its asymptote.
any two lines converging downtown has
      its hancock   its lift off      michigan avenue. pyramid


6\. the aqua

only underneath
the water from the street
can you see up

the moss hanging floors
of the waterfall cliff
orchids of light
off the ledge balconies

the re-vegetation
of the canyon
the re-visualization of our spaces
from our animal

need to be curious about what’s around
our corners not just
that they square.


the walls of wave canyons
beneath the southwest   wash out up here
with clear views divest of the ground
to dust   of much that has lifted them to where

they can see
is runoff.
a drainage of romanoff
richness in its dissolution   of geography.

the appalachian humps—
bodies bedded the long house
state to horizon    the smokies roused
from the valleys by the updrafts’ bump

you to look up into
a landscape from a bird up   turned view.


7\. 860-880 lake shore drive

we were discussing how devoid of everything—
it was
             she was listening to our conversation
she said   she had lived in one
of his residences   and it was calmly scary


how the building almost wasn’t there
yet everything you needed was
within reach
                      the way she went
at things was the way it was
already it was like there
were no walls
                           which made it feel
really spacious   she was never in a place
that fit her so every
where she turned was where
she wanted
it directed her in
that it didn’t

everything was there
everything else was out of her way
it was as if he refused
to build in the way   anything ever again.   it was almost insane.


* * *
                              _( lake point )_
rippley mies
van der rohe licorice
melting      farthest out

into the lake
walls waving around
like a curtain   a sail
of window

melting into solid wind
lotte lenya singing brecht
the remembered ship

against which the rational was not a defense.
which loaded his tools.
nothing but the existence of line
left   not even a rule.   the pencil   the point wavering


8\. marina

pie in the sky with petal
pinched crust   stacked high
above its park of delivering vehicles
on the river   a pie boat too

can cut in   (there’s a marina) home
to pinecone peel down balcony
symmetry fun for tie up
and sing dock of the day   as it.

this city doesn’t hold back
bay manners up   nor not
talk straight    it does look like
a corncob.   a celestial gate   from here

a bean.   cakes
of ice   with faces on them. us.   a fountain.


the base.   the column.
of river   wheels   roof
over your head with food
and amenities layered in

between
your work all day and immediate
need to sit down   without traffic
stacked up in one convenient

location   residents willing to pay
for required.   freedom
of imagination   insight   into freedom—
the capital.      let’s say

to try anything once
but more deeply   freedom from fear   of response.


9\. the drawbridge houses

the boats go by
the drawer
bridge pants’ flies
go up

the river
like the moaners’ bench
of fifteen-year-old boys when
the girls go by.

think how heavy the weight
that balancing   lifts
to let the delicately lilting
sails like skirts through   and the traffic

back across
if it were in your pants to toss


up or down.   the massive
concrete counterweights like balls.
streets go up   at the helens
navigating the obstructions    some

not come down   except at some castrating
war of recollection      a reconnection.
think of the engineering
of the open and close   as of arms.

who houses in the palaces of these gates.
what counter power holds place
on the bank of this flood
this flowing and crossing of desires?

the palaces   balance’s hub
a dowry to house the form   of the beloved.


11\. di chirico chapel

a Franz Kline ceiling painting on
the tunnel vault of a building
which incorporated its partial collapse
from a bombing   the black paint swaths
beside the open to the night sky
the stars
the outdated old style of stars
lit the chamber pale
a standing shadow fell across the floor
through a small open door slanted off the wall
the no one there stood outside any light to block
her hoop balanced
on its own shadow not rolling   still
a dress model of its architecture rose   off the air.


12\. the mecca

this isn’t there
anymore   something famous

is built over
it    that has nothing

to do with it    or for
now

as public
housing went up and

torn down
too to defeat

.
.

13.

robie house mock  horizon sub  urb laying down
its give up retreat from the city   back into
the low against the ground   against the high
of skyscrapers      re-carpeted the nation outside.

but is back now to reclaim
the collapsed properties   it let go grow
weed to re-gentry
heedless of tearing up whose rooms   back into profit.

the however   here
police drawn blood on their doors   have lived
dangerous and can paint it angel mad    sign again

anytime   if flipping back and forth for gain
were to spread too far   the spread could find their
horizontal shrunk to their floated upper floor.


14\. shedd aquarium

 _Arapaima gigas_   third
most ancient species   my totem fish
made so from the fact it targeted me
to eat.      six feet of it attacked me

when forgetting protocol
I slipped my legs into its tank without
warning
it    I was feeding not food   it mauled

my toe it thinking it a goldfish which
was usually how I announced service.

The Shedd’s _A_. specimen is the oldest living
in the country   so old its heavy tail
dragged down its spine into that hump of the frail.
This might be the last time we meet.


Some sheds you walk into with experience
of a specific song to reclaim.
I couldn’t see the building for checking first
the clarity of the tanks’ water   the name

plates above the windows   how well
the shit was cleaned off the bottom   and if it came
there was nothing in a tank at all   having
eaten itself—      this first fame

is what was always held up to the staff
for us to surpass.     and here I was   degrees
and jobs later   still holding it up
for inspection.   it is

a beautiful building we have built
together this life    arapaima      _gigas_. huge thanks.
