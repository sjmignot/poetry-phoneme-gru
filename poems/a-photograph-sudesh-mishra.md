# A Photograph
## Sudesh Mishra
My suited and booted grandpa
reminds me of a weighty door
hewed from fired vesi or oak.
If, upon turning the brass knob
in his breast, you push against him,
he’s swift to push against you,
and for an instant you’re a doorman
and he the mule of a man-door
until the moment of letting go
when he pulls you along after him
into an open room where history
reclines vacantly on an armchair.
