# Shame Helps
## Terese Svoboda
A sudden not-breeze fills the air.
Two men dressed in corduroy approach, one pulling a boat.
A boat of agony.
Heigh-ho. Greeting. Greeting.
Fleeting smile, both. The word _smile_ left on the faces of the fourth wall.

How to read that?
The optic nerve gets it up.
What has been done weighs the _heigh_.
The smarter of the men has a dollar hanging from a pocket.
Acquisitive or generous?

Balance implies a man out of sight line removing his shoes.
Why a man? is the question.
The philosopher in the second row wants to punch the usher.
Such restraint stupefies the audience into paradoxical sleep.
They worry but their eyeballs still roll.

And if the heavens help with a hole in the roof above the lights: drip, drip,
the two men look to the exit, shamed, unwilling to follow one or the other
without a speech.
 _Let us bury Caesar.
_
I hope we find some sand.
Creepy, the way birds in stillness sing.
