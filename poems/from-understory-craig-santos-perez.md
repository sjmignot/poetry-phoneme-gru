# From "understory"
## Craig Santos Perez
for my pregnant wife, nālani, during her second trimester
nālani and
i walk

to our
small community

garden plot
in mānoa —

the seed
packets in

my pocket
sound like

a baby’s
toy rattle —

when do
they spray

glyphosate along
the sidewalks?

from kunia
to waimea,

fifty thousand
acres of

gmo fields —
how will

open air
pesticide drift

affect our
unborn daughter,

whose nerve
endings are

just beginning
to root? —

we plant
seeds in

rows, soil
gathers under

our fingernails —
 _syngenta, dupont,
_

dow, pioneer,
basf, monsanto

 _$240_ _million
_
seed sector —

corn for
cattle feed

and syrup —
runoff turns

[our] streams
red — poisons

lo‘i — 50,000
heart sea

urchins die off —
what will

our daughter
be able

to plant
in this

paradise of
fugitive dust —
