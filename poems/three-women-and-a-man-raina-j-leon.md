I seen grains
                                       I tried to save sand
                                                                sunlit hair
of so much blow
                                       my veil thins to open pores
                                                                gathers in the
field
with bloody streams
                                       thousands died
                                                                rain stops to
let me by
oozing from poison tip places
                                       for one a bastard
                                                                when we walk
together
long thin waifs
                                       sucked from my tit
                                                                tell me
brother how
loose leg women
                                       tasted salty skin
                                                                to fill your
bowl
sucking juice from a stone
                                       I fire that heals the brand
                                                                tell me how
sparks
the pillar of God
                                       I open and closed mouth
