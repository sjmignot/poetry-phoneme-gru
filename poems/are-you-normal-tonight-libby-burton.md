# Are You Normal Tonight?
## Libby Burton
The arterial beauty of  Florida is alive in all of its obesity.
                                                                     And the
sequin-sellers are doing good business
east of  Granada Boulevard.

The sad-eyed woman’s ultrasound image—all dirty blur of gray and ambiguous
genitalia—sits
lovingly electric on your newsfeed.

                               And the neighbor with his disorder you invented
is going out tonight.

—

The starlet will eat a sandwich and Kevin will push the joke
too far—the vomit, the bobby pins—
and that’s OK tonight.

And your mother, with her rough hands, her quiet advice, has walked
along the sidewalk knowing how cold a wooden house can feel,

                                               wondering whose soft, strange
lips she could kiss.
