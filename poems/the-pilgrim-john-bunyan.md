# The Pilgrim
## John Bunyan
Who would true Valour see
Let him come hither;
One here will Constant be,
Come Wind, come Weather.
There's no _Discouragement_ ,
Shall make him once _Relent_ ,
His first avow'd _Intent,
_
To be a Pilgrim.

Who so beset him round,
With dismal _Storys_ ,
Do but themselves Confound;
His Strength the _more is_.
No _Lyon_ can him fright,
He'l with a _Gyant_ Fight,
But he will have a right _,_
_To be a Pilgrim_.

_Hobgoblin_ , __ nor foul _Fiend_ ,
Can _daunt_ his Spirit _:_
He knows, he _at the end,_
_Shall Life Inherit_.
Then Fancies fly away,
He'l fear not what men say,
He'l labour Night and Day _,_
_To be a Pilgrim_.
